Off-plan transactions are the backbone of Dubai real estate investment—and they're where consultants either prove their expertise or expose their inexperience. If you can't guide a client from EOI to title deed without surprises, you'll lose them to someone who can.

Here's what you need to master.

First, know the seven stages cold: EOI, SPA, Oqood, Construction, Completion Notice, Handover, Title Deed. Each has specific documents, timelines, and potential pitfalls. Miss a step, and you're scrambling to explain delays to an unhappy client.

Second, Oqood registration isn't optional paperwork—it's your client's legal protection against double-selling. Without it, they're trusting a developer's word. With it, the government has their back.

Third, payment tracking is your job, not theirs. Milestone payments come due whether you remind clients or not. Proactive communication prevents panicked phone calls.

Fourth, the construction period isn't quiet time—it's relationship time. Regular updates keep you relevant. Silence makes clients wonder what they're paying you for.

The key takeaway: Off-plan transactions take years. Your job is making every stage feel handled. When clients feel informed and protected throughout a three-year journey, they refer friends. When they feel confused or forgotten, they warn them away.

Master this process until it's automatic.
