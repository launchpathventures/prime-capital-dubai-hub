**CONTEXT**

Pipeline management is your daily operating system for sales. Without it, you're relying on memory and gut feel. With it, you're running a predictable business.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through the daily disciplines that keep your pipeline healthy.

First is the morning review — ten minutes every day before responding to new leads.

Check overdue actions: what was supposed to happen yesterday that didn't? These get priority. Review today's scheduled activities: what calls or meetings are booked, and what preparation is needed? Identify stalled deals: any opportunity that's been in the same stage for more than seven days needs attention. What's the blocker? Finally, count your pipeline: how many deals in each stage? Is it balanced or lopsided?

Next is your follow-up block — thirty to sixty minutes of dedicated outreach time.

Work in priority order. Start with EOIs pending SPA — these are highest value, closest to close. Then presenting stage with engagement — deals with momentum. Then qualified stage awaiting response — keep them warm. Finally, contacted stage for scheduling — build tomorrow's pipeline today.

Last is the end-of-day update — five minutes before you finish.

Update every deal you touched: what happened, what's the next action, when? Then set tomorrow's priorities: your top three deals to advance and the key action for each.

Now let's talk about pipeline stages. There are seven.

Stage One is New Lead — just received, not yet contacted. Your target: respond within sixty seconds.

Stage Two is Contacted — you've spoken or messaged, initial response made. Your target: qualify and schedule discovery within one to three days.

Stage Three is Qualified — BANT confirmed: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline. Your target: send property options within a week.

Stage Four is Presenting — actively reviewing specific properties. Your target: move to EOI within fourteen days.

Stage Five is EOI Submitted — unit reserved with EOI payment. Your target: convert to SPA signing within seven days.

Stage Six is Booked — SPA signed, booking deposit paid. Your job: support through completion.

Stage Seven is Closed Lost — the deal didn't happen. Note the reason: timing, budget, chose competitor, or other. Learn from every lost deal.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

Three mistakes to avoid.

First, orphan deals — opportunities with no next action. Every deal in your pipeline must have a specific next step and a date. No exceptions.

Second, stage inflation — keeping deals in higher stages than they belong. If someone hasn't responded in two weeks, they're not really "Presenting" — move them back or to nurture.

Third, neglecting the pipeline review — skipping the morning review feels like you're saving time, but it costs you deals. Ten minutes of clarity beats an hour of reactive chaos.

**PRO TIP**

Use the weighted pipeline method to forecast your income. Assign probability to each stage: New Lead at five percent, Contacted at ten percent, Qualified at twenty-five percent, Presenting at forty percent, EOI at seventy-five percent, Booked at ninety-five percent.

Multiply each deal's value by its probability and sum the total. If you have a one million dirham deal at Presenting, that's four hundred thousand weighted. A two million deal at EOI is one point five million weighted. Your weighted pipeline is your realistic revenue forecast.

Track this weekly, and you'll never be surprised by a slow month again.
