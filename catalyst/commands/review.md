Review implementation against its brief requirements.

@catalyst/prompts/loop-3-review.md

## Repo Context

Read before reviewing:
- The brief being reviewed
- `@catalyst/BRIEFS.md` — Brief workflow

## Process

1. **Find the brief** — If `$ARGUMENTS` provided, look for that brief
2. **Check criteria** — Go through acceptance checklist
3. **Identify issues** — Categorise by severity (critical, important, nice-to-have)
4. **Capture feedback** — Structured format for refine phase
5. **Recommend** — Ship, refine, or redo
