# Competency 5: Transaction Management

## Overview

Transaction management is where knowledge meets execution. This competency transforms you from someone who understands Dubai real estate into someone who can confidently guide clients through every stage of a property transaction—from initial Expression of Interest to final handover and beyond.

Every transaction involves multiple parties, strict regulatory requirements, and time-sensitive deadlines. Mistakes in this domain damage client trust, create legal liability, and can end careers. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

## What You'll Learn

This competency covers twelve essential modules organized into four logical sections:

### Transaction Journeys (Modules 5.1-5.2)
1. **Off-Plan Transaction Journey** — Complete roadmap from EOI to handover
2. **Secondary Transaction Journey** — MOU to transfer for resale properties

### Regulatory Framework (Modules 5.3, 5.6, 5.7)
3. **RERA Smart Contracts** — Understanding the legal framework
4. **Oqood Registration** — Off-plan contract registration requirements
5. **Escrow Accounts** — Buyer protection mechanisms

### Transaction Stages (Modules 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10)
6. **EOI & Booking Process** — Initial commitment and documentation
7. **SPA & Down Payment** — Sales and Purchase Agreement execution
8. **Mortgage Process** — Financing options and bank requirements
9. **MOU & Form F** — Secondary market agreements
10. **NOC & Transfer** — Developer NOC and DLD transfer process

### Completion (Modules 5.11-5.12)
11. **Handover Process** — Property inspection and key collection
12. **Post-Transaction Service** — Ongoing client relationship after close

## Why This Matters

Transaction management is where Prime Capital differentiates itself from high-volume agencies. Our clients—sophisticated HNW investors—expect:

- **Accuracy:** Every document correct, every deadline met
- **Transparency:** Clear explanations of each step and cost
- **Proactivity:** Anticipating issues before they become problems
- **Protection:** Ensuring their investment is legally sound

Many agencies treat transactions as administrative tasks. We treat them as opportunities to demonstrate the expertise that justifies our positioning.

**The Reality:**
- One missed deadline can kill a deal worth hundreds of thousands in commission
- One incorrect document can create legal liability for you and the firm
- One confused client who doesn't understand the process will never refer others
- One smooth transaction creates a client for life and multiple referrals

## Time Commitment

**Estimated Duration:** 9 hours total (540 minutes)

This is the most substantial competency in the curriculum because transactions are where the rubber meets the road. Take your time with each module—rushing through transaction knowledge creates problems that surface months later when you're mid-deal and don't understand a critical step.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this competency, you should have completed:
- Competency 0: Foundations (compliance and professional standards)
- Competency 1: Market Intelligence (regulatory framework basics)

## Assessment

You'll encounter three knowledge checks:
- **Quiz 1** after Module 5.1 (Off-Plan Transaction Journey)
- **Quiz 2** after Module 5.3 (RERA Smart Contracts)
- **Quiz 3** after Module 5.9 (MOU & Form F)

All require 80% to pass. You can retake quizzes if needed.

## Module Types

This competency includes different module types:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Knowledge** | Understand concepts and frameworks |
| **Knowledge + Checklist** | Understand AND have a reference checklist |
| **Skills** | Practice applying knowledge |
| **Skills + Checklist** | Practice with reference checklist |
| **Skills + Script** | Practice with example dialogues (includes Coach Walkthrough) |

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 5.1: Off-Plan Transaction Journey. Work through the modules in order—each builds on the previous one and follows the logical flow of actual transactions.
