**CONTEXT**

Failure is inevitable in sales. The question isn't whether you'll experience it—you will—but how you'll respond. Handle failures well, and you preserve relationships for future opportunities. Handle them poorly, and you burn bridges and accumulate stress.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk through the four most common failure scenarios and how to handle each.

**Scenario one: The ghost.** A client disappears after several viewings. They were engaged, seemed interested, then nothing.

What to do: After one week of silence, send a straightforward message asking if everything's alright, giving them an easy out to say circumstances have changed. After two to three weeks with no response, send one more attempt, then stop active pursuit. Add them to your low-touch newsletter if appropriate.

What not to do: Multiple messages in quick succession, guilt-inducing language, or creating false urgency.

**Scenario two: Lost to another agent.** A client tells you they've purchased through someone else.

What to do: Stay gracious. This tests your professionalism. Thank them for letting you know, congratulate them on their purchase, and offer to help with questions in the future. Process your feelings privately—don't act on disappointment in any client-facing way.

What not to do: Ask why you lost, criticise the other agent, or express frustration to the client.

**Scenario three: Deal falls through at NOC stage.** The transaction is nearly complete, then it falls apart. Perhaps the seller changed their mind, financing fell through, or issues emerged.

What to do: With the buyer, express regret it didn't work out, explain what happens next regarding deposits and timeline, and offer to look at other options when they're ready. Document everything immediately—this protects you if disputes arise.

**Scenario four: Developer delays handover.** A client purchased off-plan through you. The developer has delayed by 12 months. The client is frustrated and blaming you.

What to do: Acknowledge their frustration. Clarify your role—you introduced them to the project, the delay is the developer's responsibility, but you won't leave them to handle it alone. Offer to advocate—reach out to the developer, find out what compensation is being offered, keep them informed.

What not to do: Accept blame that isn't yours or disappear to avoid the difficult conversation.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, taking failures personally in client-facing interactions. Feel what you feel privately, but remain professional in every communication.

Second, failing to document. After any failure, record what happened, when, and why. This protects you and helps you learn.

Third, neglecting resilience practices. Daily intention-setting, end-of-day review, and weekly win documentation prevent failures from accumulating into burnout.

**PRO TIP**

Use the Permission to Close technique when stuck. After extended engagement with no progress, give them permission to decide either way. Say: "You have the information you need. If this isn't right, tell me no and we'll close this chapter gracefully. If it is right, let's move forward. Either answer is better than staying in limbo." This creates space for honesty and often breaks the cycle.
