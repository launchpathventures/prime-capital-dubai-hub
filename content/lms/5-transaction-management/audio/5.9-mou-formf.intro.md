Form F is legally binding the moment both parties sign. That ten percent deposit isn't a holding fee—it's at risk. Mistakes in this document—wrong names, vague conditions, unclear terms—create disputes that can derail transactions and destroy relationships.

Here's what precision looks like.

First, Form F execution is now fully digital through the Dubai REST platform. Both parties sign electronically, the system timestamps everything, and copies are distributed automatically. No more paper forms passed between offices. Learn the online process—watch the official YouTube tutorials for Form A, Form B, and Form F creation.

Second, names must match exactly. Buyer name as it appears on passport. Seller name as it appears on title deed. One spelling difference creates problems at DLD transfer. Verify against original documents, not memory.

Third, conditions precedent must be specific. "Subject to financing" isn't good enough. "Subject to buyer obtaining mortgage pre-approval of minimum AED 1.5 million within fourteen days" is clear. Vague conditions create arguments about whether they've been satisfied.

Fourth, deposits are typically held by conveyancing companies as neutral third parties. When no conveyancing company is used, the seller's agent holds the deposit. Either way, use proper procedures—deposit disputes with documented arrangements are manageable. Unclear deposit handling creates nightmares.

Fifth, when co-broking with another agent, execute Form I early. This agent-to-agent agreement establishes commission splits before closing. Don't wait until the deal closes to discuss who gets paid what. Agree terms in writing at the start.

The key takeaway: Form F is the foundation of secondary transactions. Master the digital process, execute Form I for co-broker deals, and ensure accuracy throughout. Rush through it with errors, and you'll spend weeks fixing preventable issues.
