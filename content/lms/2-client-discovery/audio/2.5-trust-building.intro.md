Discovery questions mean nothing if you don't hear the answers. Most agents listen to respond, not to understand. They're mentally preparing their next question while the client is still talking. They hear keywords but miss context and emotion.

Active listening transforms surface conversations into genuine understanding.

The framework is LACE. Listen completely before responding—let them finish. Acknowledge what they've shared—validate before redirecting. Clarify anything unclear—ask follow-ups. Explore deeper when warranted—don't accept surface answers.

Every client statement has layers. There's the literal words—what they actually say. The underlying needs—what the request represents. The emotional content—feelings behind the words. And unstated context—what they're not saying but you should know.

Techniques matter. Paraphrasing confirms understanding and shows you're listening. Reflection mirrors emotional content back, building trust. Summarizing synthesizes what you've heard and creates transition points. Silence is powerful—resist filling every pause.

The common failures are predictable. The assumption trap—thinking you know what they mean based on similar clients. The solution rush—jumping to recommendations before fully understanding. The expert trap—interrupting with your knowledge.

Listen to understand. Everything else follows from that.
