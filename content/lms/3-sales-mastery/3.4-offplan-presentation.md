# Off-Plan Presentation Skills

## Introduction

Presenting off-plan properties requires a different approach than ready properties. You're selling a vision, a developer's track record, and a financial proposition — not just a physical space.

---

## The Challenge of Off-Plan

### What You're Up Against

**Buyers can't:**
- Walk through the actual unit
- See the finished views
- Experience the community
- Touch the materials

**So you must:**
- Paint a vivid picture
- Build confidence in the developer
- Make the numbers clear
- Address timeline concerns

---

## The Off-Plan Presentation Structure

### The BUILD Framework

**B - Background (Developer & Location)**
Establish credibility before introducing the property.

**U - Understanding Check**
Confirm the property matches their discovered needs.

**I - Investment Proposition**
Present the financial case clearly.

**L - Layout & Features**
Walk through the unit and development.

**D - Decision Pathway**
Explain next steps and timeline.

---

## Section B: Background (Developer & Location)

### Establishing Developer Credibility

**Script:**

> "Before I show you the specific units, let me give you some context on the developer.
>
> [Developer Name] has been in the Dubai market since [year]. They've delivered [number] projects, including [notable example]. Their handover track record is strong — their last three projects delivered on time, which is important in this market.
>
> This development, [Project Name], is in [location]. This area has seen [relevant growth/development]. Major landmarks include [X, Y, Z], and it's [X] minutes from [key destination]."

**Why this works:**
- Addresses the unspoken question: "Can I trust this developer?"
- Provides social proof through track record
- Anchors the property in a real place they can understand

### Location Presentation

**Key points to cover:**
- Distance to key destinations (airport, downtown, beaches)
- Planned infrastructure (metro lines, road expansions)
- Existing amenities (schools, healthcare, retail)
- Community development status

---

## Section U: Understanding Check

### Confirming Fit Before Deep Dive

**Script:**

> "Based on what you shared earlier — you're looking at primarily investment, budget around AED [X] million, and interested in [area/type]. This development fits that profile because [specific reason].
>
> Before I go deeper, does this general direction feel right to you?"

**Why this works:**
- Shows you listened
- Gets buy-in before investing presentation time
- Allows course correction if needed

---

## Section I: Investment Proposition

### Presenting the Financial Case

**Three components to cover:**

1. **Entry price and payment structure**
2. **Expected rental yield**
3. **Capital appreciation potential**

### Payment Plan Presentation Script

> "Let me walk you through the payment structure. This is a [X%] during construction, [Y%] on handover plan.
>
> For a unit priced at AED [total], here's how it breaks down:
>
> - **Booking fee:** AED [amount] (typically 5-10%)
> - **During construction:** [X%] spread over [Y] months
> - **On handover:** [Z%]
>
> So your total outlay during construction is AED [amount], with the balance due when you receive the keys.
>
> What this means practically: you're controlling a [total value] asset with [upfront amount] initially, and [monthly amount] during build."

**Payment Plan Visual:**

| Stage | Percentage | Amount (AED) | Timing |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Booking | 10% | XXX,XXX | On reservation |
| 1st Installment | 10% | XXX,XXX | 30 days |
| During construction | 30% | XXX,XXX | Monthly over 24 months |
| On handover | 50% | X,XXX,XXX | Completion |

### ROI Projection Script

> "In terms of returns, let's look at the numbers conservatively.
>
> **Rental yield:** Similar units in completed buildings nearby are achieving AED [rent] per year, which would represent around [X%] gross yield. After service charges and management, you're looking at [Y%] net.
>
> **Capital appreciation:** This area has seen [X%] price growth over the past [Y] years. Off-plan specifically has shown [relevant data]. I always recommend being conservative — budget for [realistic %] annual growth rather than peak figures.
>
> **Important context:** These are projections based on current market data. Real estate markets fluctuate, and past performance doesn't guarantee future results. But the fundamentals here are strong because [specific reasons]."

**Why honesty matters:**
- Sophisticated investors see through inflated projections
- Conservative numbers build trust
- You're positioning as an advisor, not a salesperson

## Section L: Layout & Features

### Walking Through the Unit

**Script structure:**

> "Now let me show you the specific unit. This is a [type], [X] bedrooms, [Y] sq ft.
>
> [Using floor plan or rendering]
>
> Here's the entry, leading into the main living space. As you can see, it's [describe layout benefit — open plan, good flow, etc.].
>
> The master bedroom is here, with [features]. The secondary bedroom(s) are here.
>
> Key features that stand out on this unit:
> - [Feature 1 and why it matters]
> - [Feature 2 and why it matters]
> - [Feature 3 and why it matters]
>
> For the development overall, you have access to [amenities — pool, gym, etc.]. The building includes [relevant features — parking, concierge, etc.]."

### Development Amenities

**Cover:**
- On-site facilities (pool, gym, spa)
- Retail and dining within development
- Parking allocation
- Concierge and management services
- Community features (parks, play areas)

---

## Section D: Decision Pathway

### Explaining Next Steps

**Script:**

> "So that's the overview of [Development Name]. If this feels like a good fit, here's how the process typically works:
>
> 1. **Next step:** We reserve the unit with an EOI (Expression of Interest) — typically AED [amount], fully refundable at this stage
> 2. **Due diligence:** You review the SPA (Sales Purchase Agreement), payment schedule, and development specs
> 3. **Formal booking:** Sign the SPA and pay the booking fee within [X] days
> 4. **Construction phase:** Regular payments according to the schedule, with updates from the developer
> 5. **Handover:** Final payment and receive your keys
>
> What questions do you have at this point?"

## Coach Walkthrough: Presentation Scenarios

### Practice Scenario 1: New Launch Presentation

**Situation:** You're presenting a new Emaar development in Dubai Creek Harbour to a UK investor looking for rental yield.

**Focus on:**
- Developer credibility (Emaar's track record)
- Location potential (Dubai Creek Tower, waterfront)
- Rental yield comparison with similar areas
- Payment plan advantages

### Practice Scenario 2: Payment Plan Walkthrough

**Situation:** An investor is confused about how payment plans work. They're used to UK mortgages where you pay one lump sum.

**Focus on:**
- Clear explanation of the construction-linked payment model
- Cash flow benefits during build
- Comparison with traditional purchase
- Post-handover financing options

### Practice Scenario 3: ROI Discussion

**Situation:** An investor is asking "What return can I expect?" and wants specifics.

**Focus on:**
- Providing realistic ranges, not false precision
- Explaining the two components (yield + appreciation)
- Acknowledging market variables
- Building credibility through honesty

## Handling Common Questions

### "What if the developer delays?"

> "That's a valid concern. Here's how we address it:
>
> First, [Developer Name] has a strong track record — [specific delivery history]. Second, RERA in Dubai provides buyer protection with escrow accounts — developer payments are linked to construction milestones, not developer promises. Third, delayed handover clauses in the SPA typically allow you to exit or receive compensation if delays exceed a threshold.
>
> That said, I always recommend building in a buffer in your planning — expect handover to be the stated date plus 6-12 months as a realistic scenario."

### "What's the exit strategy?"

> "Good question. You have several options:
>
> 1. **Assignment:** Sell your contract during construction to another buyer (subject to developer approval and fees)
> 2. **Resale:** List the property on the secondary market after handover
> 3. **Hold and rent:** Generate rental income while property appreciates
>
> For off-plan specifically, there's often a premium achievable closer to handover as the property becomes more 'real' to buyers who prefer seeing finished product."

### "How do I know the unit will look like this?"

> "Great question. Several things protect you:
>
> First, the SPA includes detailed specifications — materials, finishes, fixtures. These are legally binding. Second, [Developer Name]'s previous projects at [example] show their quality standard — I can show you photos of delivered units. Third, you have a snag inspection before accepting handover, where you can flag any issues.
>
> That said, renders are always slightly aspirational. The actual view, for example, will depend on what's built around you. I always set the expectation: 'similar to this, not identical.'"
