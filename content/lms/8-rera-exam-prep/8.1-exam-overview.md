# RERA Exam Overview

## Why This Matters

The RERA broker exam is your gateway to legal practice in Dubai real estate. Without passing this exam and obtaining your broker card, you cannot facilitate property transactions, earn commissions, or represent clients legally. Many candidates underestimate the exam and fail on their first attempt—understanding the format and requirements gives you a critical advantage.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Underestimating the exam**
Many candidates assume general industry knowledge is sufficient. The exam tests specific regulatory details and numbers.

❌ **Not memorizing exact numbers**
Questions about fees, timelines, and fines require exact figures. "Approximately" answers are usually wrong.

❌ **Rushing through questions**
With 60 minutes for 40 questions, you have 90 seconds per question. Read scenarios carefully—details matter.
