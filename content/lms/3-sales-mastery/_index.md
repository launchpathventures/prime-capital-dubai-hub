## Why This Matters

Off-plan sales require a different approach than secondary market transactions. You're not just selling a property — you're selling a vision, a timeline, and a developer's track record.

**The reality:**
- 60% of Dubai property transactions are off-plan
- Buyers can't walk through the unit — they decide based on plans and renderings
- Your credibility and communication skills directly impact conversion
- Speed matters: leads contacted within 60 seconds convert at 3x the rate

**What separates top performers:**
- Systematic approach to lead qualification
- Confident presentation of payment plans and ROI projections
- Ability to handle timeline and completion concerns
- Consistent follow-up that maintains engagement without pressure
