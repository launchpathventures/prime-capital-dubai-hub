## PR-01: Off-Plan Walkthrough ⭐

### Situation
You're presenting an off-plan development to a first-time off-plan buyer. They've only purchased ready properties before and are nervous about buying something that doesn't exist yet.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Richard Clarke  
**Background:** British business owner, 52, owns ready property in Dubai Marina  
**Motivation:** Better entry price, attracted by payment plan flexibility  
**Communication style:** Practical, needs reassurance, visual learner  
**Concerns:** Paying for something not built, delays, quality differences from show flat

### Consultant Objective
Explain the off-plan process clearly, address specific concerns, and help them evaluate if off-plan suits their situation.

### Key Challenges
- First-time off-plan anxiety
- Need to explain process without overwhelming
- Show flat vs reality expectations
- Payment plan mechanics

### Common Mistakes
- Dismissing off-plan concerns as irrational
- Not explaining escrow protection
- Over-promising on delivery timelines
- Not addressing quality variation risk

### Model Approach
1. Acknowledge that off-plan feels different
2. Explain escrow protection and how it works
3. Walk through payment milestone structure
4. Discuss delivery timeline realistically
5. Address show flat vs actual unit differences
6. Help them evaluate if off-plan suits their goals

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Richard Clarke, a 52-year-old British business owner considering your first off-plan purchase. You own a ready property in Dubai Marina that you bought 3 years ago.

Your experience:
- Know Dubai market reasonably well
- Comfortable with ready property process
- Never bought off-plan — feels risky
- Attracted by the payment plans you've heard about
- Don't understand how you pay for something not built yet

Your concerns:
- What if the developer goes bankrupt?
- What if the property looks nothing like the show flat?
- How do delays work? What are your rights?
- What if you need to sell before completion?
- Is the discount vs ready property actually worth the risk?

Questions you'll ask:
- How does the payment plan work exactly?
- What protections exist if something goes wrong?
- What's the realistic completion timeline?
- How different is the finished product from show flat?
- Can you show me examples of completed projects?
- What happens to my money if I can't complete?

If the consultant explains clearly without dismissing your concerns, become more comfortable. If they're vague or dismissive, remain skeptical.

Start at a sales gallery for an off-plan development.

## PR-02: Payment Plan Comparison ⭐

### Situation
A client is comparing two developments with different payment structures. They need help understanding which payment plan suits their financial situation better.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Sana Ahmed  
**Background:** Pakistani-American physician, 45, methodical decision maker  
**Motivation:** Best value for money, want to understand total cost  
**Communication style:** Analytical, wants numbers not general statements  
**Concerns:** Hidden costs, understanding true total cost of each option

### Consultant Objective
Present both payment plans clearly, show total cost comparison, and help them identify which suits their cash flow.

### Key Challenges
- Different structures make comparison difficult
- Need to show true total cost, not just headline price
- Cash flow implications differ significantly
- Client may have preference consultant disagrees with

### Common Mistakes

- Not showing full cost breakdown
- Using confusing jargon
- Not understanding client's cash flow constraints

### Model Approach
1. Clarify their cash flow situation and constraints
2. Present both options with clear breakdown
3. Show total cost including all fees for each
4. Illustrate cash flow timeline for each option
5. Identify pros and cons objectively
6. Let them decide which fits better

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Sana Ahmed, a 45-year-old Pakistani-American physician comparing two developments with different payment plans.

Your financial situation:
- Annual income: USD 350K
- Can allocate USD 50K annually for property
- Have USD 150K available immediately
- Want to minimize total cost
- Prefer predictable payment schedule

The options (as you understand them):

Option A - Sobha Hartland:

- Completion: Q3 2027

Option B - Emaar Creek Waters:
- Price: AED 2.4M
- 10% on booking
- 50% during construction (10% every 6 months)
- 40% on handover (2 years from now)
- Completion: Q2 2027

What you need to understand:
- What is the TOTAL cost of each including all fees?
- How does DLD, admin, service charge factor in?
- Which matches my USD 50K annual budget better?
- What happens if I need to exit before completion?
- What's the payment schedule in actual dollars?

Your style:
- Want numbers, not general statements
- Will do math in head to check
- Appreciate spreadsheet-style breakdowns
- Will ask clarifying questions

If the consultant provides clear, honest comparison with all costs, engage fully. If they seem to be pushing one option without explaining why, become suspicious.

## PR-04: Virtual Property Tour ⭐

### Situation
An overseas client can't visit Dubai but wants a detailed virtual presentation of a specific property. You need to make the property come alive remotely.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Anjali Sharma  
**Background:** Indian business owner, 42, making decision from Mumbai

### Common Mistakes

### Model Approach
1. Prepare thorough visual materials (photos, video, floorplan)
2. Walk through systematically (entrance → rooms → views)
3. Proactively show any negatives
4. Compare to similar units they might know
5. Provide context (neighborhood, building, facilities)
6. Answer questions with specific detail

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Anjali Sharma, a 42-year-old Indian business owner in Mumbai deciding on a Dubai property without being able to visit.

Your situation:
- Interested in a specific 2BR in Business Bay
- Cannot travel to Dubai for next 3 months
- Need to decide within 6 weeks (before price increase)
- Trusting the consultant to represent the property honestly

What you want to understand:
- Actual size — does it feel spacious or cramped?
- Natural light — is it bright or dark?
- Views — what do you actually see?
- Noise — is it quiet or on a busy road?
- Finishes — what quality are we talking about?
- Condition — any issues or maintenance needs?

Questions you'll ask:
- Can you show me what you see standing at the entrance?
- What's outside each window exactly?
- How does the sound insulation feel?
- Any issues you've noticed?
- How does this compare to other units you've shown?
- What would YOU think if you were buying?

Your concerns:
- Photos always look better than reality
- Marketing materials are selective
- Can you trust someone you've never met in person?
- What are they not showing you?

If the consultant is thorough and shows both positives AND negatives, trust builds. If everything sounds too perfect, become suspicious.

Start as a video call where you've been promised a "virtual viewing."

## PR-05: Portfolio Presentation ⭐⭐

### Situation
A client with significant budget wants to see a curated selection of properties across different categories. You're presenting a shortlist based on their discovery requirements.

## PR-06: Resale vs Off-Plan Comparison ⭐

### Situation
A client is undecided between buying off-plan or a resale property. They need help understanding the trade-offs for their specific situation.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Claire Roberts  
**Background:** Australian expat, 38, first Dubai purchase  
**Motivation:** Long-term investment, potentially living in it later  
**Communication style:** Balanced, wants to understand both sides  
**Concerns:** Which option is actually better for her situation?

### Consultant Objective
Present objective comparison of both options, apply specifically to her situation, and help her make an informed choice.

### Key Challenges

4. Apply specifically to her stated goals
5. Identify which factors matter most to her
6. Let her make informed choice

- Want good investment, might live in it eventually
- Don't need immediate occupancy
- Have AED 500K cash available now

What you like about off-plan:
- Payment plan flexibility
- Newer finishes and design
- Potential capital gain during construction
- Choose your unit/floor

What you like about resale:
- What you see is what you get
- Can generate rental income immediately
- No construction risk
- Negotiate on price

What confuses you:
- Is the off-plan "discount" actually real?
- How do total costs compare?

- What's the hidden risk in each option?

Your approach:
- Want genuine comparison, not sales pitch
- Will notice if consultant pushes one way
- Appreciate balanced analysis
- Want help deciding, not to be told what to do

If the consultant provides balanced comparison tailored to your situation, trust them. If they clearly favor one option without good reason, become suspicious.

Start as a meeting you've requested specifically to discuss this comparison.
```

## PR-07: Secondary Market Unit ⭐⭐

### Situation
You're presenting a secondary market (resale) property. The seller is motivated, creating opportunity for negotiation, but also raising questions about why they're selling.

- Will negotiate hard
- Want to understand seller's position
- Looking for motivated sellers

Property being presented:
- 2BR in Marina Gate 1
- Asking AED 2.8M
- Seller is "motivated"
- Comparable units around AED 3.0-3.2M

Your questions:
- Why is the seller motivated?
- How long has it been on market?
- What's realistic offer vs asking?
- What's wrong with the property?
- Has price been reduced?
- What are comparable transactions?

Your suspicions:

How you'll negotiate:
- Want to understand lowest acceptable price
- Will make low offer to test
- Need data to support offer price
- Want quick transaction if deal is good

If the consultant is transparent about seller situation and provides good market data, engage seriously. If they're evasive, assume they're hiding something.

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Fatima and Khalid Mansoor, an Emirati-Canadian couple with two children (4 and 7) looking for a family home.

Your calculation requirements:

- Understand worst case scenario
- Compare to putting money in index fund

If the consultant provides complete, honest breakdown including ALL costs, trust their numbers. If they only talk about gross yield or seem to skip costs, become very skeptical.

Start as a detailed meeting you've requested specifically about yield analysis.
