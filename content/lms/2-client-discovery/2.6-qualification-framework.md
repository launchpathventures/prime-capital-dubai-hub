# BANT+ Qualification

Not every inquiry becomes a transaction, and not every transaction is worth pursuing. Qualification is the skill of determining whether a prospect is ready, able, and suitable for a purchase—and whether you're the right advisor for them.

## Why Qualification Matters

**For the Client**: Unqualified buyers waste their own time viewing properties they can't or won't purchase. Qualification protects them from frustration.

**For You**: Time spent with unqualified prospects is time not spent with qualified ones. Effective qualification is how you protect your most limited resource.

**For the Transaction**: Deals that fall apart late in the process damage everyone. Early qualification surfaces issues before time and emotion are invested.

## The BANT+ Framework

BANT is a classic qualification framework. We've extended it with two additional dimensions for Dubai real estate advisory.

| Element | Question Being Answered |
|---------|------------------------|
| **B** — Budget | Can they afford the properties that meet their needs? |
| **A** — Authority | Are they the decision-maker, or is someone else involved? |
| **N** — Need | Is there a genuine need driving the purchase? |
| **T** — Timeline | Is there a realistic timeline for completion? |
| **+F** — Fit | Are they a fit for our advisory approach? |
| **+C** — Capability | Can they execute the transaction logistically? |

---

## B — Budget Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Do they have the funds for properties matching their requirements?
- Is their budget realistic for what they're seeking?
- Can they cover all transaction costs (4% DLD, agency fees, etc.)?

### Qualification Questions

> "What budget range are you working with for this purchase?"

> "Have you accounted for transaction costs—typically 6-7% on top of property price?"

> "Is this budget funded from liquid assets, or does it depend on selling something else?"

> "If financing, have you explored UAE mortgage options or spoken with a broker?"

### Red Flags

- **Budget doesn't match requirements**: Wants premium Marina 3-bed but budget is AED 1M
- **Vague budget responses**: "Flexible" or "depends" without any range
- **Dependent on uncertain liquidity**: "Once my other property sells" or "after my funding round closes"
- **No awareness of additional costs**: Surprised by 4% DLD fee

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Budget matches requirements | ✅ Proceed |
| Budget slightly below requirements | Educate on realistic options, adjust expectations |
| Budget significantly misaligned | Have honest conversation or decline to proceed |
| Dependent on uncertain liquidity | Wait until funds are confirmed before investing time |

---

## A — Authority Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Can this person make the purchase decision?
- Who else influences or controls the decision?
- What's the decision-making process?

### Qualification Questions

> "Are you making this decision independently, or will others be involved?"

> "If there are other stakeholders—partner, family, business partners—what's their role in the decision?"

> "Have you discussed this investment with them already? What's their perspective?"

> "What typically happens in your household/business when making decisions of this magnitude?"

### Red Flags

- **Unknown decision-makers**: "I'll need to check with my brother" (who you've never spoken to)
- **Passive language**: "We might be interested if my wife agrees"
- **Absent co-decision-maker**: Refuses to include spouse/partner in conversations
- **Business complexity**: Investment committee or board approval required but not mentioned

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Sole decision-maker | ✅ Proceed |
| Identified co-decision-maker | Request to include them in conversations |
| Vague additional stakeholders | Clarify decision process before proceeding |
| Complex approval process | Understand timeline and requirements |

---

## N — Need Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Is there a genuine need driving this purchase?
- Is the need urgent or exploratory?
- Will the need persist long enough to complete a transaction?

### Qualification Questions

> "What's prompting your search right now? Why now specifically?"

> "If you don't purchase in the next [3/6/12] months, what happens?"

> "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to making a purchase?"

> "What would cause you to put this on hold or decide not to proceed?"

### Red Flags

- **No driving need**: "Just looking," "exploring options," "seeing what's out there"
- **Distant or vague need**: "Eventually we'd like to..." or "Someday we might..."
- **Need is conditional**: "If my visa gets approved..." or "If the business goes well..."
- **Serial explorer**: Has been "looking" for 2+ years without purchasing

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear, time-bound need | ✅ Proceed actively |
| Need exists but not urgent | Stay in touch, don't over-invest time now |
| Exploratory only | Provide information, add to nurture list |
| Conditional need | Wait for condition to resolve |

---

## T — Timeline Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- When do they need to complete the purchase?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are there external deadlines driving the timeline?

### Qualification Questions

> "When would you ideally complete this purchase?"

> "Are there any external deadlines—visa requirements, school enrollment, business needs?"

> "If the right property appeared tomorrow, how quickly could you move?"

> "What's driving that timeline?"

### Red Flags

- **No timeline**: "Whenever we find the right thing" with no sense of urgency
- **Unrealistic timeline**: "Need to complete next week" for a complex transaction
- **Timeline not aligned with need**: Says urgent but calendar shows 18-month window
- **Dependent timeline**: "Once other things fall into place"

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear timeline within 6 months | ✅ Proceed actively |
| Timeline 6-12 months | Stay engaged, pace appropriately |
| Timeline 12+ months or unclear | Light touch, periodic check-ins |
| Urgent but unrealistic | Educate on process, reset expectations |

---

## +F — Fit Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Are they a good fit for Prime Capital's advisory approach?
- Do their values and expectations align with how we work?
- Will this be a productive, respectful relationship?

### Fit Criteria

**Good Fit Signals**:
- Values expertise over transaction speed
- Respects professional boundaries
- Communicates honestly and directly
- Open to education and advice
- Treats advisory as partnership, not service

**Poor Fit Signals**:
- Expects you to show 50 properties before deciding
- Dismissive of expertise ("I know the market")
- Disrespectful of your time (constant no-shows, late night calls)
- Only interested in discounts and kickbacks
- Already working with multiple agents simultaneously

### Qualification Questions

> "What's been your experience with property advisors in the past?"

> "What do you value most in an advisory relationship?"

> "How do you prefer to work—hands-on collaboration or more independent review?"

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Strong fit indicators | ✅ Proceed with confidence |
| Mixed signals | Clarify expectations, proceed cautiously |
| Clear poor fit | Decline politely, refer elsewhere |

## +C — Capability Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Can they logistically execute the transaction?
- Are there practical barriers to completion?
- Do they have necessary documentation and status?

### Capability Requirements

**For International Buyers**:
- Valid passport
- Ability to travel to Dubai (or reliable POA arrangement)
- Ability to transfer funds internationally
- No sanctions or compliance issues

**For Financing**:
- UAE residency or qualifying non-resident status
- Income documentation
- Credit history acceptable to UAE banks
- Deposit funds available

### Qualification Questions

> "Are you able to travel to Dubai for viewings and completion, or would you need to work remotely?"

> "Have you transferred funds internationally before? Any concerns about moving money to UAE?"

> "If financing, do you have the documentation UAE banks typically require—salary certificates, bank statements?"

### Red Flags

- **Cannot visit Dubai**: And unwilling to grant POA
- **Fund transfer concerns**: Restrictions from home country, compliance issues
- **Documentation gaps**: Self-employed with complex income, recent job changes
- **Compliance issues**: PEP status, source of funds concerns

---

## The Qualification Conversation

Qualification doesn't have to feel like an interrogation. Embed it naturally:

**Script Example**:

> "To make sure I'm recommending the right opportunities, let me understand a few things about your situation. What budget range are you comfortable with, including transaction costs?"

[Budget response]

> "Perfect. And who's involved in this decision—is it just yourself, or are there others?"

[Authority response]

> "Understood. What's driving the interest in Dubai right now? Any specific timeline you're working with?"

[Need and Timeline response]

> "Great. Just to confirm logistics—you're able to travel to Dubai for viewings, and there aren't any concerns about fund transfers from your end?"

[Capability response]

## Qualification Scoring

After discovery, score each BANT+ element:

| Element | Score | Criteria |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Budget | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Aligned / Marginal / Misaligned |
| Authority | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Sole / Shared / Unclear |
| Need | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Urgent / Exists / Absent |
| Timeline | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Clear / Vague / None |
| Fit | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Strong / Mixed / Poor |
| Capability | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Clear / Questions / Barriers |

**Interpretation**:
- 5-6 ✅ = Highly qualified, prioritize
- 3-4 ✅ = Qualified with attention points
- 1-2 ✅ = Likely unqualified, proceed cautiously
- Any ❌ = Address before proceeding

---

## Declining Unqualified Prospects

Sometimes the right answer is no. Do it gracefully:

> "Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure I'm the right fit for what you're looking for right now. You might find better value working with [alternative]. But please do stay in touch if your situation changes."

> "I want to be honest with you. Given [specific issue], I think we'd both be frustrated if we proceed now. Let's reconnect when [condition] is resolved."

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **BANT+ covers six dimensions**: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, Fit, Capability

2. **Qualification protects everyone** — Client's time, your time, and transaction integrity

3. **Red flags require action** — Don't ignore warning signs hoping they'll resolve

4. **Declining is professional** — It's better to say no early than waste everyone's time

5. **Score every prospect** — Systematic qualification prevents emotional decisions
