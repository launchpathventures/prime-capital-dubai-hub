questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor says: 'I've been looking at Dubai for months but I just can't decide. Everyone tells me it's great but something doesn't feel right.' What type of objection is this?"
    options:
      - text: "Information gap—they need more data"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concern—there's a hidden worry they haven't voiced"
        correct: true
      - text: "Negotiation tactic—they're trying to get a better deal"
        correct: false
      - text: "Buying signal—they're ready to move forward"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When someone says 'something doesn't feel right' but can't articulate what, there's usually an unspoken concern. This requires exploration to uncover the real objection, not more information."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "You've explained escrow protections to an investor. They respond: 'I hear what you're saying, but I'm still worried about delays.' What went wrong?"
    options:
      - text: "You didn't explain escrow clearly enough"
        correct: false
      - text: "You addressed the wrong concern—they're worried about delays, not protections"
        correct: true
      - text: "The investor is being unreasonable"
        correct: false
      - text: "Nothing—you should repeat the same information"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The 'but' reveals they weren't satisfied. More importantly, you may have answered a different question than what was really troubling them. Escrow protects money; they're worried about timeline. The 'Explore Deeper' step was needed first."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What is the primary purpose of the 'Acknowledge Validity' step in LAER?"
    options:
      - text: "To agree with the investor's conclusion"
        correct: false
      - text: "To buy time while you formulate a response"
        correct: false
      - text: "To show respect for the concern and reduce defensiveness"
        correct: true
      - text: "To identify if the objection is legitimate"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Acknowledging validity is not agreement—it's respect. 'That's a sensible question' validates their concern without conceding the point. This reduces defensiveness and creates space for your response to be heard."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Which of the following is the STRONGEST form of evidence when responding to objections?"
    options:
      - text: "Your personal experience with similar investors"
        correct: false
      - text: "Logical reasoning based on market fundamentals"
        correct: false
      - text: "Specific data from authoritative sources (DLD, RERA)"
        correct: true
      - text: "Testimonials from satisfied clients"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Specific data from authoritative sources like DLD, RERA, and bank reports provides the strongest evidence. It's objective, verifiable, and carries institutional credibility that personal experience cannot match."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor asks increasingly specific questions about payment processes, handover timelines, and paperwork requirements. What type of objection is this likely to be?"
    options:
      - text: "Genuine concern—they're worried about the process"
        correct: false
      - text: "Information gap—they need more details"
        correct: false
      - text: "Negotiation tactic—they're testing your knowledge"
        correct: false
      - text: "Buying signal in disguise—they're mentally preparing to move forward"
        correct: true
    explanation: "When objections become more specific and practical—focusing on logistics, timelines, and processes—it often indicates serious interest. The investor is mentally preparing to move forward, not seeking reasons to say no."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor becomes visibly upset and says: 'You agents are all the same—just telling me what I want to hear!' What should you do?"
    options:
      - text: "Defend yourself by explaining how you're different"
        correct: false
      - text: "Pause, take a breath, and respond to the content, not the tone"
        correct: true
      - text: "Mirror their energy to show you're taking them seriously"
        correct: false
      - text: "Redirect to a different topic to reduce tension"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When defensive, pause before responding, take a breath, and remember this is about them, not you. Respond to the content of their concern ('You want honest advice, not a sales pitch') rather than their tone. Your composure under pressure defines your professionalism."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "After you address an objection, the investor immediately raises a completely different concern. Then another. Then another. What is likely happening?"
    options:
      - text: "They have many genuine concerns that need addressing"
        correct: false
      - text: "Multiple objections cascading may signal they need space or this is 'no' in disguise"
        correct: true
      - text: "You need to address each concern more thoroughly"
        correct: false
      - text: "This is a buying signal—they're getting serious"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When multiple objections cascade rapidly, the investor may be overwhelmed or the real objection is 'no' that they can't voice directly. This is a sign to step back gracefully rather than keep addressing new concerns."

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What distinguishes a negotiation tactic objection from a genuine concern?"
    options:
      - text: "Negotiation tactics are always about price"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns are asked with genuine curiosity; tactics often feel rehearsed and appear at suspicious timing"
        correct: true
      - text: "Negotiation tactics come from experienced investors only"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns never involve commercial terms"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Negotiation tactics often feel rehearsed, focus on commercial terms, and appear at suspicious timing (after significant engagement). Genuine concerns have emotional undertones and are asked with curiosity. The distinction helps you respond appropriately."
