TYPE: skills-script

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Welcome to Property Presentation — where you'll learn to present properties in a way that builds confidence, not pressure.

Here's the key mindset shift: you're not selling a property. You're helping an investor make a confident decision. When you present properties well, investors feel informed and empowered. When you oversell, they feel pressured and sceptical.

In this module, you'll learn the presentation structure that works. Restate the brief to confirm understanding. Introduce the shortlist with context. Present each property consistently. State trade-offs honestly. And give your recommendation when asked — framed as guidance, not direction.

You'll also learn viewing best practices — how to manage the physical experience without hovering, over-explaining, or pushing.

By the end, you'll present properties in a way that demonstrates expertise and earns trust. Clients will see you as an advisor who helps them decide, not a salesperson who wants them to buy.

Let's see what good looks like.

### DEMO (3-5 minutes)

**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of presenting shortlisted properties to an investor. Sarah, based in London, is looking for an investment property in Dubai. She wants a one-to-two bedroom, budget one point two to one point five million, ready property with immediate rental income, targeting five percent net yield or better. You've shortlisted two properties and are presenting over video call.

**WEAK DEMO**

*Consultant:* "Hi Sarah, I've got some great options for you. Let me share my screen.

So first one is Marina Diamond, fourteenth floor, partial marina view. It's eight fifty square feet, one point two eight million — great price. Previous rent was seventy-five thousand but I think we can get more, maybe eighty, eighty-five. The building's about eight years old but really well maintained. Yield would be around six percent gross, maybe five net — really strong.

Second one is JLT, nice lake view. Smaller at seven eighty square feet but cheaper at one point zero five million. Already tenanted at sixty-two thousand. Yield is similar, maybe slightly lower. JLT is good for young professionals.

So yeah, both are good options. Marina is nicer but JLT is cheaper. What do you think? Do you want to view them?"

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Let's break down what went wrong.

First, no brief confirmation. Did Sarah's requirements change? We don't know because we didn't ask.

Second, vague numbers. "Maybe eighty, eighty-five" — maybe? "Around six percent" — are you sure? This erodes confidence.

Third, no structure. Jumping between facts randomly. Size, then price, then rent, then age, then yield. Impossible to compare.

Fourth, trade-offs hidden. Marina is "nicer" — why specifically? JLT is "good for young professionals" — but Sarah is an investor. How does that matter to her?

Fifth, neither yield hits her target. Both are below five percent net. Why didn't we address that?

Sixth, pressure close. "What do you think? Do you want to view them?" — before she's had time to process anything.

The investor leaves overwhelmed, uncertain, and probably shopping elsewhere for better advice.

**STRONG DEMO**

*Consultant:* "Sarah, thanks for making time. I've found two properties that fit what we discussed. Before I share them, let me confirm I've understood your requirements correctly.

You're looking for a one-to-two bedroom in an established area, budget between one point two and one point five million, ready property so you can start earning immediately, targeting five percent or better net yield, and you want something with good liquidity when you eventually sell. Does that still capture it?"

*Sarah:* "Yes, that's right. Maybe leaning towards a one-bed if the numbers work better."

*Consultant:* "Good to know. Both options I have are one-beds, so that works.

Let me share my screen and walk you through them.

Property One: Marina Diamond, Unit fourteen-oh-seven.

This is a one-bedroom in Marina Diamond, fourteenth floor, partial marina view. The building is about eight years old, well-maintained, managed by Emaar Community Management.

Size: eight fifty square feet plus balcony. Asking price: one point two eight million. Current status: vacant, immediate handover. Service charges: fifteen dirhams per square foot, so about twelve thousand seven fifty annually.

The unit was previously rented at seventy-five thousand. Based on current comparables, I'd estimate seventy-eight thousand is achievable. That gives a gross yield of six point one percent, and after service charges, management, and vacancy allowance, you're looking at approximately four point five percent net.

Why I selected it: It's in your budget with room to spare, excellent building reputation, and Marina has proven rental demand and resale liquidity. The marina view, even partial, holds value.

The trade-off: The yield is under your five percent target at four point five percent net. To hit five percent or higher, you'd either need to negotiate the price down by about seventy thousand dirhams, or we'd need to find a property in a higher-yield area."

*Sarah:* "What's the second option?"

*Consultant:* "Property Two: JLT Cluster M, Unit eight-oh-six.

This is a one-bedroom in JLT, eighth floor, lake view. Building is newer — completed in twenty-nineteen — and well-managed.

Size: seven eighty square feet. Asking price: one point zero five million. Current status: tenanted at sixty-two thousand until November. Service charges: thirteen dirhams per square foot, so about ten thousand one forty annually.

With the existing tenant at sixty-two thousand, the gross yield is five point nine percent. Net yield is approximately four point three percent after costs.

Why I selected it: It's significantly under budget at one point zero five million, has lower service charges than Marina, and JLT has good tenant demand. The existing tenant is a bonus — you'd start earning immediately with no vacancy gap.

The trade-off: The yield doesn't quite hit your five percent target either, and JLT is less prestigious than Marina for resale. When you come to sell, Marina properties typically move faster and command stronger prices per square foot. You're trading some capital appreciation potential for the lower entry price."

*Sarah:* "So Marina for capital growth, JLT for cash flow?"

*Consultant:* "That's the key trade-off, yes. Both properties fall slightly short of your five percent net yield target — Marina at four point five percent and JLT at four point three percent. But the JLT property has the lower entry price, which gives you more capital flexibility.

If your priority is rental income and you're comfortable holding for five to seven years, JLT makes sense. If you're focused on total return and might want to sell sooner, Marina is more resilient.

The two hundred thirty thousand price difference is also meaningful. That capital could sit in a savings account earning four to five percent, or go towards a second property in future."

*Sarah:* "Which would you choose?"

*Consultant:* "Honestly? For pure investment, I'd probably take JLT. The yield is strong, the tenant removes vacancy risk, and the lower entry price gives you optionality.

But if I wanted something I might use personally in future — or if I valued having a Dubai Marina address — I'd pay the premium for Marina Diamond.

Neither is wrong. It depends on whether you're optimising for income or prestige."

*Sarah:* "Can I view both?"

*Consultant:* "Absolutely. For the Marina unit, we can schedule anytime this week. For JLT, we need to coordinate with the tenant, but they've been cooperative on viewings. I'll arrange both for the same day so you can compare directly. Would Thursday work for you?"

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Notice what made this work.

First, confirmed requirements. "Does that still capture it?" Shows listening and catches any changes.

Second, consistent structure. Location, size, price, status, service charges, yield, why selected, trade-off — same order for both properties. Easy to compare.

Third, precise numbers. "Four point five percent net" not "around five percent." "Twelve thousand seven fifty" not "about twelve thousand." Precision builds confidence.

Fourth, honest about shortfall. Neither property hits the five percent target. Said so directly rather than hiding it.

Fifth, trade-offs stated clearly. Marina for capital growth and prestige. JLT for lower entry and cash flow. The investor can weigh what matters to her.

Sixth, recommendation when asked. "For pure investment, I'd probably take JLT." But framed as preference, not pressure. "Neither is wrong."

Seventh, clear next steps. Both viewings on the same day. Specific day proposed.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest change: structure and honesty. Present each property the same way so they're comparable. State trade-offs clearly — including when options don't meet targets. Help the investor decide rather than pushing them to buy.
