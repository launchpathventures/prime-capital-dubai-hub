The SPA is the most important document in any off-plan transaction—and most agents just hand it over and ask clients to sign. That's not advising. That's clerking. Your job is making sure clients understand what they're committing to before they commit.

Here's what SPA excellence requires.

First, review before presenting. Read the entire SPA yourself. Verify client name matches passport, unit number is correct, price and payment plan match what was agreed. Catch errors before the client meeting, not during.

Second, explain the clauses that matter: completion date and grace period, payment schedule and late fees, cancellation terms for both parties, defects liability and specifications. Clients shouldn't sign binding contracts they don't understand.

Third, the down payment goes to escrow only—never to a developer's general account, never to an agent, never in cash. Any request otherwise is a red flag.

Fourth, post-signing follow-up isn't optional. Submit documents to developer, confirm receipt, track Oqood registration, remind clients about upcoming payments. The transaction doesn't manage itself.

The key takeaway: How you handle SPA signing tells clients whether you're their advisor or just someone processing their paperwork. Take the time to explain the document. Answer every question. Make them feel confident about what they're signing. That's how you build clients for life.
