# Discovery: End-Users

End-users are buying a home, not just a property. Their decisions are influenced by emotion, lifestyle considerations, and family needs. Your discovery must address both practical requirements and the less tangible factors that make a house feel like home.

## The End-User Discovery Framework

### Opening the Conversation

End-users need to feel heard before they'll share openly. Start with rapport-building questions that show genuine interest in their situation.

**Opening Script**:
> "Thank you for reaching out. Before we look at any properties, I'd love to understand more about you and what you're hoping to achieve with this move. Can you tell me a bit about what's prompting your search?"

This open question invites them to share their story, not just their property criteria.

---

## Discovery Question Sequence

### 1. Relocation Context

Understand why they're considering Dubai and their current situation.

**Key Questions**:

> "Where are you currently based, and what's driving the decision to look at Dubai?"

> "Have you spent time in Dubai before? What were your impressions?"

> "Is this a definite move, or are you still weighing Dubai against other options?"

> "What timeline are you working with for the relocation?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Urgency level (exploring vs. committed)
- Prior Dubai experience (needs education vs. confirmation)
- Alternative locations being considered (competitive context)
- External deadlines (school year, work start date, visa expiry)

---

### 2. Family & Household

Understand who will be living in the property and their specific needs.

**Key Questions**:

> "Tell me about your household—who will be living in the property?"

> "Do you have children? What ages, and are there specific school requirements?"

> "Are there any family members with particular needs we should consider—elderly parents, anyone with accessibility requirements?"

> "Do you have pets? What kind?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Bedroom count requirements
- School proximity needs
- Accessibility considerations
- Pet-friendly community requirements
- Multi-generational living needs

---

### 3. Lifestyle Priorities

Understand what matters most in their day-to-day life.

**Key Questions**:

> "Walk me through what an ideal week looks like for your family. What activities and routines matter most?"

> "How do you typically commute—will you be driving, or do you prefer walkable areas?"

> "What social and recreational facilities are important to you—pools, gyms, tennis, golf?"

> "Do you entertain at home often? Is outdoor entertaining space important?"

> "How important is being close to dining, retail, and nightlife vs. a quieter residential community?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Community type preference (urban vs. suburban)
- Must-have amenities
- Space requirements (entertaining, home office)
- Noise and activity tolerance
- Beach/water access importance

---

### 4. Property Preferences

Get specific about the property itself.

**Key Questions**:

> "What type of property are you envisioning—apartment, villa, townhouse?"

> "Is there a minimum size you need? How many bedrooms and bathrooms?"

> "How important is outdoor space—balcony, garden, pool?"

> "Any strong preferences on property age—brand new, or open to older properties?"

> "What about views—sea, city skyline, golf course, garden?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Property type flexibility
- Non-negotiable requirements vs. nice-to-haves
- View and orientation preferences
- New vs. resale openness
- Quality and finish expectations

---

### 5. Location & Community

Understand area preferences and constraints.

**Key Questions**:

> "Are there specific areas of Dubai you're drawn to? What attracts you to them?"

> "Are there areas you'd prefer to avoid? Any particular reasons?"

> "How important is being close to your workplace? Where will you be working?"

> "Do you have friends or family already in Dubai? Would you like to be near them?"

> "What's your tolerance for construction—many developing areas have ongoing projects nearby?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Pre-formed area biases (educated or not)
- School and work commute constraints
- Social network location
- Construction noise tolerance
- Community vs. location priority

---

### 6. Budget & Financials

Approach financials with care—end-users are more sensitive than investors.

**Key Questions**:

> "What budget range are you comfortable with for this property?"

> "Will you be paying cash or arranging financing? Do you have a UAE relationship yet?"

> "Have you factored in additional costs—DLD fees, agency fees, moving costs?"

> "Will you be selling a property elsewhere to fund this purchase?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Realistic budget expectations
- Financing pre-approval status
- Liquidity and timing constraints
- Currency exchange considerations
- Dependency on selling existing property

---

### 7. Future Planning

Understand the long-term picture.

**Key Questions**:

> "How long do you see yourself in this property? Is it a long-term home or a stepping stone?"

> "If circumstances change—job relocation, family changes—would you sell or rent out?"

> "Are you thinking about this purely as a home, or does the investment aspect matter too?"

> "Any thoughts on Golden Visa? Would you like the property to qualify?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Time horizon for ownership
- Exit strategy thinking
- Investment awareness
- Visa requirements
- Flexibility in plans

## Coach Walkthrough: End-User Discovery Practice

*This section demonstrates end-user discovery technique through a realistic dialogue. The `<speak>` tags indicate content optimized for text-to-speech practice.*

<speak>

### Scenario

**Client Background**: Sarah and James, a British couple in their early 40s with two children (ages 8 and 12). James has been offered a role in Dubai starting in 6 months. Sarah works remotely.

**Your Task**: Conduct discovery to understand their requirements.

### Sample Discovery Dialogue

**You**: "Sarah, James, thank you for your time today. Before we dive into properties, I'd love to understand more about your situation and what you're hoping to find. Can you tell me about what's prompting this move?"

**James**: "I've been offered a position with a Dubai-based firm. We've visited before on holiday and loved it, but living here is obviously different."

**You**: "That's exciting—congratulations on the opportunity. You mentioned you've visited before. What were your impressions, and what excited you about potentially living here?"

**Sarah**: "The weather, the safety, the lifestyle really. The kids would love the beach and outdoor life. We're in London now and the grey winters are getting to us."

**You**: "I hear that often from UK families. Tell me about your children—what ages are they, and are there specific school requirements we should factor in?"

**Sarah**: "They're 8 and 12. The older one is in year 8, so we'd need a British curriculum school. We've heard good things about JESS and Kings but don't really know the landscape."

**You**: "Both excellent schools. School proximity often shapes where families look. Are you thinking of areas where you'd drive them, or would you prefer walking distance to school?"

1. **Lead with lifestyle, not specs** — End-users buy homes, not properties

2. **Understand the whole family** — Everyone living there has needs that matter

3. **Schools often drive location** — For families with children, this is frequently the first filter

4. **Respect the emotional component** — Don't dismiss feelings; they're part of the decision

5. **Check future thinking** — Even end-users should consider exit scenarios
