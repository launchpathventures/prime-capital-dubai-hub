# Yield & ROI Calculations

## Why Numbers Matter

Sophisticated investors make decisions based on returns. They want to know: "What will this property earn me?"

Getting yield calculations wrong — or being unable to explain them clearly — destroys credibility. Getting them right positions you as a knowledgeable advisor, not just a salesperson.

## Gross Yield

Gross yield is the simplest calculation. It shows annual rent as a percentage of purchase price.

### Formula

```
Gross Yield = (Annual Rent / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Worked Example 1

**Property:** Marina apartment  
**Purchase price:** AED 2,000,000  
**Monthly rent:** AED 10,000  
**Annual rent:** AED 120,000

```
Gross Yield = (120,000 / 2,000,000) × 100 = 6.0%
```

### Worked Example 2

**Property:** Downtown studio  
**Purchase price:** AED 950,000  
**Monthly rent:** AED 5,500  
**Annual rent:** AED 66,000

```
Gross Yield = (66,000 / 950,000) × 100 = 6.9%
```

### What Gross Yield Tells You

Gross yield is useful for quick comparisons between properties. Higher gross yield generally means better income relative to price.

**However:** Gross yield doesn't account for costs. It's a starting point, not the final answer.

## Net Yield

Net yield subtracts operating costs from rental income before calculating the percentage.

### Formula

```
Net Yield = ((Annual Rent - Annual Costs) / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Common Operating Costs

| Cost | Typical Range | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Service charges | AED 12-25/sqft/year | Higher for branded/luxury |
| Property management | 5-8% of rent | If using a management company |
| Maintenance reserve | 1-2% of property value | For repairs and upkeep |
| Vacancy allowance | 4-8% of annual rent | Assumes 2-4 weeks vacant per year |
| RERA fees | AED 160-220/year | Registration and Ejari |

### Worked Example 3: Full Net Yield Calculation

**Property:** Marina 2BR apartment  
**Purchase price:** AED 2,500,000  
**Size:** 1,400 sqft  
**Monthly rent:** AED 14,000  
**Annual rent:** AED 168,000

**Operating costs:**
- Service charges: 1,400 × AED 18 = AED 25,200/year
- Property management: AED 168,000 × 5% = AED 8,400/year
- Maintenance reserve: AED 2,500,000 × 1% = AED 25,000/year
- Vacancy allowance: AED 168,000 × 5% = AED 8,400/year
- RERA fees: AED 200/year

**Total annual costs:** AED 67,200

**Net operating income:** AED 168,000 - AED 67,200 = AED 100,800

```
Net Yield = (100,800 / 2,500,000) × 100 = 4.0%
```

**Compare to gross yield:**
```
Gross Yield = (168,000 / 2,500,000) × 100 = 6.7%
```

The gap between gross (6.7%) and net (4.0%) shows why costs matter.

### Worked Example 4: Service Charge Impact

Two similar properties, different service charges:

**Property A: Standard building**
- Purchase price: AED 1,800,000
- Size: 1,100 sqft
- Annual rent: AED 95,000
- Service charge: AED 14/sqft = AED 15,400/year

**Property B: Branded residence**
- Purchase price: AED 1,800,000
- Size: 1,100 sqft
- Annual rent: AED 95,000
- Service charge: AED 28/sqft = AED 30,800/year

**Property A net income:** AED 95,000 - AED 15,400 = AED 79,600  
**Property B net income:** AED 95,000 - AED 30,800 = AED 64,200

**Property A net yield:** 4.4%  
**Property B net yield:** 3.6%

Same purchase price, same rent — but service charges create 0.8% yield difference.

## Total Return

Yield measures income. Total return measures income plus capital appreciation.

### Formula

```
Total Return = ((Annual Rent - Costs + Capital Gain) / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Worked Example 5

**Property purchased 3 years ago:**
- Purchase price: AED 1,500,000
- Current value: AED 1,800,000
- Total capital gain: AED 300,000
- Annualised capital gain: AED 100,000/year

**Annual net rental income:** AED 60,000

```
Annual Total Return = ((60,000 + 100,000) / 1,500,000) × 100 = 10.7%
```

**Breakdown:**
- Yield contribution: 4.0%
- Capital appreciation: 6.7%
- Total return: 10.7%

## Presenting Yields to Investors

### Be Clear About What You're Quoting

Always specify whether you're quoting gross or net. Never let an investor assume.

**Don't say:** "This property yields 7%."  
**Do say:** "The gross yield is 7%. After service charges and management fees, the net yield is approximately 5.2%."

### Show Your Working

Sophisticated investors want to see the calculation, not just the answer.

**Example presentation:**

"Let me walk you through the numbers on this property:

- Purchase price: AED 2.1 million
- Expected rent: AED 125,000 per year based on recent comparable leases
- That gives a gross yield of 5.95%

Now for the costs:
- Service charges run about AED 18 per square foot, so roughly AED 21,600 annually
- We'll budget 5% for property management if you want hands-off ownership
- And a 5% vacancy allowance is prudent

Net of those costs, you're looking at around AED 85,000 — a net yield of 4.0%.

Where this property gets interesting is capital appreciation. This area has seen 8-12% annual growth over the past three years."

### Handle Yield Objections

**"That yield seems low compared to other markets."**

"You're right that headline yields in Dubai are typically 4-6% net, which is lower than some emerging markets. Two factors to consider: rental income is tax-free in the UAE, and capital appreciation has averaged 8-10% in premium areas over the past five years. The total return picture is often more compelling than yield alone."

**"How confident are you in these rental estimates?"**

"I base rental estimates on actual leases in the same building or comparable properties within the past 90 days. I can share specific comparables with you. I'd rather give you a realistic number than one we can't achieve."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Quoting gross as if it's net** — Misleads investors and damages trust
2. **Ignoring service charges** — Especially problematic for branded residences
3. **Assuming zero vacancy** — Unrealistic; always budget for turnover
4. **Forgetting purchase costs** — DLD fees (4%), agency fees (2%), mortgage fees if applicable
5. **Comparing apples to oranges** — Compare gross to gross, net to net

## Key Takeaways

1. **Gross yield = quick comparison** — Annual rent / purchase price
2. **Net yield = realistic income** — After service charges, management, vacancy
3. **Total return = full picture** — Income plus capital appreciation
4. **Always specify which yield** — Never leave investors guessing
5. **Show your calculations** — Transparency builds trust
6. **Service charges matter** — Can reduce yield by 1-2%
