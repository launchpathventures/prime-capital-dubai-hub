Let me show you two versions of handling the classic comparison question: "Why Dubai over London?" Same question—but very different levels of credibility.

A UK investor says: "I have always invested in London. Why would I take my money to Dubai instead?"

The agent says: "Dubai is much better than London. Higher yields, no taxes, better weather—it is obviously the smarter choice. London is overpriced and the yields are terrible. Plus, you do not get any residency benefits in London. Everyone is moving their money to Dubai now. The smart investors have already figured this out."

The client responds: "I do not know. I have done well in London for 20 years. It feels risky to change."

The agent says: "London is a declining market. The smart money is all coming here. You do not want to be left behind."

Coach analysis. Here is what went wrong:

First, he attacked London instead of positioning Dubai. Clients with 20 years of London experience will not appreciate being told their market is "declining."

Second, he made unsupported claims. "Everyone is moving their money" and "smart money" are generic and unpersuasive to sophisticated investors.

Third, he dismissed the client's comfort and experience. The client's familiarity with London is legitimate—ignoring that concern does not make it disappear.

Fourth, he created an either-or framing. Why would a client abandon something that has worked to go all-in on something unfamiliar?

Now here is how to handle this conversation with credibility:

The agent says: "Twenty years of London experience is valuable—you understand that market deeply, and it has served you well. I am not suggesting you abandon what works.

But let me share how some investors with similar backgrounds are thinking about it."

The client responds: "I am listening."

The agent says: "They are keeping their London portfolio but allocating new capital to Dubai. Here is why the numbers are interesting.

On a 1 million pound London property, you might achieve 3.5% gross yield. After income tax at your marginal rate—let us say 45%—that is perhaps 2% net. And when you sell, you are looking at 28% capital gains tax on appreciation.

The same capital in Dubai could achieve 7% gross—and that is also 7% net, because there is no income or capital gains tax. Over a 10-year hold, that tax differential compounds significantly."

The client responds: "The tax angle is interesting. But what about the risk? London feels safer."

The agent says: "That is a fair concern, and I would not dismiss it. London has deeper market liquidity and a longer track record. If you need to exit quickly, London is probably easier.

But let us look at risk from another angle. Currency risk: the pound has been volatile. If your income is in pounds and your wealth is in pound-denominated assets, you have concentration risk. Dubai is dollar-pegged, which provides diversification.

Regulatory risk: Dubai's regulatory framework has matured significantly since 2008. RERA oversight, mandatory escrow for off-plan, clear title deed systems—these protections now match international standards.

And there is one thing Dubai offers that London does not: the Golden Visa. 2 million dirhams—roughly 450,000 pounds—gets you a 10-year residency visa. For investors who value global optionality, that is significant."

The client responds: "I had not thought about it as diversification rather than replacement. That framing makes more sense."

The agent says: "Exactly. This does not have to be Dubai instead of London. It can be Dubai alongside London. Many UK investors are allocating 20 to 30% of new investment capital here while maintaining their London base.

The question is: does it make sense to explore whether Dubai fits your portfolio? I would be happy to show you specific opportunities and run the numbers on your situation. No pressure—just information to help you decide."

Coach analysis. Here is what made this effective:

First, he respected the client's experience. Starting with "20 years of experience is valuable" acknowledges their success rather than dismissing it.

Second, he used specific numbers. 3.5% gross, 2% net after tax, 7% in Dubai—concrete figures are persuasive where generic claims are not.

Third, he addressed risk honestly. He acknowledged London's advantages—liquidity and track record—while reframing other risk dimensions.

Fourth, he positioned Dubai as addition, not replacement. "Diversification rather than replacement" is a much easier decision for clients to make.

Fifth, he closed with low commitment. "Just information to help you decide" feels safe and respects the client's autonomy.

The key difference: The weak example attacked the client's existing choice. The strong example expanded their thinking. One created defensiveness, the other created openness. When handling global market comparisons, respect what has worked for the client—then show them how Dubai might work alongside it.
