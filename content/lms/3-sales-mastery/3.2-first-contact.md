# First Contact Excellence

## Module 3.2 — Skills + Script

The first 60 seconds of contact determine whether you earn a conversation or lose to a faster competitor. This module gives you the scripts and skills to win that critical window.

---

## The 60-Second Window

### Why Speed Matters

**The data is clear:**

| Response Time | Conversion Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Under 60 seconds | 3x higher conversion |
| 1-5 minutes | Baseline conversion |
| 5-30 minutes | 80% drop in conversion |
| 30+ minutes | Lead likely contacted by competitor |

**What's happening on the other side:**

When an investor submits an enquiry on Property Finder:
- Their enquiry goes to 3-5 agents simultaneously
- They're often still browsing when your call comes
- The first professional response anchors their expectations
- They mentally "assign" the opportunity to whoever responds first

### Speed-to-Lead Implementation

**Your 60-second protocol:**

1. **Notification setup** — Portal app on phone with alerts
2. **Pre-prepared templates** — Ready to personalise and send
3. **Calendar discipline** — Blocked time for immediate response during peak hours
4. **Backup coverage** — Team member handles when you're in meetings

**Peak response hours:** 9-11am and 7-9pm (when most buyers browse)

## Primary Script: Portal Lead Response

### Scenario: New enquiry from Property Finder/Bayut

**Step 1: Immediate WhatsApp (within 60 seconds)**

> Good [morning/afternoon], [First Name]!
>
> This is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I noticed your enquiry about [Property/Development Name].
>
> It's a strong choice — [one specific positive about the property].
>
> Are you free for a quick 5-minute call now, or would you prefer I send some key details first?

**Why this works:**
- Uses their name immediately (personal)
- Confirms you received their specific enquiry
- Adds value with one insight (you're not generic)
- Offers choice (respects their time)

**Step 2: Follow-up call (if no response in 3 minutes)**

> "Hi [First Name], it's [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I just sent you a WhatsApp about [Development Name] — wanted to make sure you received it. Do you have two minutes?"

**If they answer — proceed to conversation**

**If voicemail:**

> "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I received your enquiry about [Development Name] and wanted to share some information that might be useful. I'll send you a message with details and my number. Looking forward to speaking with you."

**Step 3: Second WhatsApp (if no response after 15 minutes)**

> "Hi [First Name] — I know you're probably busy, so I've put together a quick summary of [Development Name] for you:
>
> • Starting from AED [price]
> • [Key feature 1]
> • [Key feature 2]
>
> Happy to discuss whenever works for you. What's your availability like this week?"

## "If They Are Busy" Recovery Script

### Scenario: Lead answers but is busy

**When you hear:** "Now's not a good time" / "I'm in a meeting" / "Call me back later"

**Your response:**

> "No problem at all — I appreciate you picking up. Just one quick question before I let you go: are you looking at this primarily as an investment or for personal use? That way, when we reconnect, I can share the most relevant options."

**Why this works:**
- Respects their time (builds trust)
- Gets one qualifying answer (saves time later)
- Creates commitment to follow-up
- Demonstrates professionalism

**Follow-up protocol:**

> "Perfect. I'll send you a WhatsApp with my details. What time works better for you — morning or evening?"

*Wait for answer, then confirm:*

> "Great, I'll call you [tomorrow morning/this evening]. Talk soon."

**Then immediately send:**

> "Hi [First Name] — as promised, here are my details:
>
> [Your Name]
> Prime Capital
> [Phone number]
>
> Looking forward to our call [tomorrow morning/this evening]. Feel free to message me here if anything changes."

## Website Enquiry Script

### Scenario: Lead submitted form on your website

Website leads have higher intent — they chose you specifically.

**Opening:**

> "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. Thank you for reaching out through our website. I've had a look at your enquiry and wanted to connect directly.
>
> You mentioned [reference something from their form]. What sparked your interest in Dubai property right now?"

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges they chose your firm
- Shows you read their enquiry (not generic)
- Opens with a discovery question

## Coach Walkthrough: Portal Lead Response

### Practice Scenario 1

**Situation:** You receive a Property Finder notification for a lead enquiring about Emaar Beachfront apartments.

**Your task:** Record yourself delivering the 60-second WhatsApp response, then the follow-up call script.

**What to focus on:**
- Timing (actually hit 60 seconds)
- Natural delivery (not robotic)
- Personalisation (use the development name)

### Practice Scenario 2

**Situation:** The lead answers your call but says "I'm actually in a taxi heading to a meeting right now."

**Your task:** Practice the busy recovery script. Get one qualifying answer and set a callback time.

**What to focus on:**
- Staying calm and professional
- Not talking too much
- Getting a concrete follow-up commitment

## Common First Contact Mistakes

### What NOT to do:

**1. The Generic Opener**
> ❌ "Hi, I saw you were looking at property. How can I help?"

*Problem: No personalisation, no value, sounds like everyone else.*

**2. The Feature Dump**
> ❌ "Let me tell you about this amazing development — it has a gym, pool, 24-hour security, marble floors..."

*Problem: Features without context. They don't care yet.*

**3. The Pressure Opener**
> ❌ "Are you ready to make an offer? I need your decision today!"

*Problem: Aggressive, destroys trust, confirms "pushy agent" fears.*

**4. The Delayed Response**
> ❌ Responding 2 hours later: "Sorry for the delay, I was busy with clients..."

*Problem: They've already spoken to someone else. And don't apologise.*

### What TO do:

**1. Acknowledge their specific enquiry**
> ✅ "I noticed your enquiry about [Development Name] — it's a strong choice because..."

**2. Add one piece of value**
> ✅ "Interestingly, they've just released new payment plans on that project..."

**3. Offer choice, not pressure**
> ✅ "Would you prefer a quick call now, or shall I send details to review first?"

**4. Be fast, then be helpful**
> ✅ Response within 60 seconds, value within 60 more.

## Speed-to-Lead Data: What Top Performers Know

### Response Time Analysis

A study of 100,000 real estate leads found:

| Response Time | Contact Rate | Qualification Rate |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0-1 minute | 78% | 45% |
| 1-5 minutes | 56% | 32% |
| 5-30 minutes | 24% | 12% |
| 30+ minutes | 8% | 4% |

### What This Means for You

**The 60-second window:**
- You're nearly 10x more likely to reach the lead
- They're still in "property search mode"
- You anchor their expectations before competitors
- You demonstrate responsiveness (trust signal)

**The compound effect:**
- 10 leads per week at 78% contact rate = 8 conversations
- 10 leads per week at 24% contact rate = 2 conversations
- Over a year: 416 conversations vs. 104 conversations
- Same leads, dramatically different results

---

## Building Your Response System

### Non-Negotiables

1. **Phone notifications ON** — Portal apps with sound alerts
2. **Templates prepared** — Personalise in seconds, not minutes
3. **Calendar blocked** — 9-11am and 7-9pm are sacred response times
4. **WhatsApp Web open** — Faster typing than phone
5. **CRM updated immediately** — Every contact logged

### When You Can't Respond in 60 Seconds

Sometimes you're genuinely unavailable. Have a backup:

**Option A: Team coverage**
- Colleague monitors leads during your meetings
- Handoff protocol: They make first contact, you follow up

**Option B: Auto-response + quick follow-up**
- Automated message acknowledging receipt
- You call within 30 minutes with personal touch

**Option C: Prioritisation**
- If multiple leads arrive, prioritise by source tier
- Tier 1 (portal) before Tier 2 (social)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **60 seconds is the window** — Treat it as non-negotiable
2. **Speed without quality fails** — Fast AND professional
3. **Busy leads aren't lost** — Use the recovery script
4. **One qualifying question** — Always leave the call with something
5. **Build systems, not willpower** — Automate what you can

---

## Practice Exercise

**This week:**
1. Set up portal notifications with sound
2. Prepare your personal templates (adapt the scripts above)
3. Track your response times for every lead
4. Practice the busy recovery script until it's natural

**Target:** 80% of leads contacted within 60 seconds by end of week.
