# Closing Techniques

## Module 3.7 — Skills + Script

Closing isn't manipulation — it's helping someone who's ready to buy actually make the decision. This module teaches you to recognise when they're ready and guide them confidently to commitment.

---

## The Philosophy of Closing

### What Closing Actually Is

**Wrong view:** "Closing is about getting them to say yes"
**Right view:** "Closing is about removing barriers for someone who wants to buy"

If someone doesn't want your property, no technique will change that. But if someone does want it and is hesitating due to uncertainty, fear, or indecision — that's where closing skills matter.

### The Prime Capital Approach

We don't use:
- High-pressure tactics
- Manipulation
- False urgency
- Guilt or shame

We do use:
- Clear communication
- Confidence in our recommendations
- Help with decision-making
- Respect for their timeline

## Recognising Buying Signals

### Verbal Buying Signals

**Direct signals (high confidence):**
- "How do we proceed?"
- "What's the next step?"
- "Can I reserve this unit?"
- "I want this one."

**Indirect signals (medium-high confidence):**
- "What's included in the price?"
- "When is the handover date?"
- "Can I do the paperwork remotely?"
- "What's the payment schedule again?"

**Conditional signals (medium confidence):**
- "If I were to proceed..."
- "Assuming the developer is reliable..."
- "This would work if..."

**Question clusters:**
- Asking multiple logistical questions in succession
- Revisiting details they've already covered
- Asking about post-purchase matters (rental, management)

### Non-Verbal Buying Signals

**In person:**
- Leaning forward during conversation
- Taking notes
- Asking partner for opinion
- Reviewing floor plan repeatedly
- Checking phone less frequently

**On calls/video:**
- Longer pauses (thinking it through)
- Asking to see documents again
- Involving others in the conversation
- More animated tone

### Signal Progression

| Stage | Signal Type | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Early interest** | General questions | "Tell me more about the area" |
| **Active consideration** | Specific questions | "Which units have best views?" |
| **Near decision** | Logistics questions | "How does the EOI work?" |
| **Ready to buy** | Process questions | "What do I need to sign?" |

## Closing Techniques

### Technique 1: The Assumptive Close

**When to use:** When you've received clear buying signals and the decision feels natural.

**How it works:** Assume the decision is made, focus on logistics.

**Script:**

> "Great, it sounds like [Unit X] is the right fit. Let me walk you through what happens next. I'll send over the EOI form now — do you prefer to complete it digitally or would you like me to talk you through each section?"

**Why it works:**
- Removes the "big decision" feeling
- Makes the next step feel natural
- Doesn't force them to explicitly say "yes"

### Technique 2: The Summary Close

**When to use:** When they've expressed multiple positive points but haven't committed.

**How it works:** Summarise everything they've agreed with, then ask for commitment.

**Script:**

> "Let me make sure I've captured this correctly. You liked [Development] because of [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3]. The payment plan works within your budget, and the timeline fits your goals. It checks all your boxes. Shall we secure this unit for you?"

**Why it works:**
- Reminds them why they're interested
- Creates momentum through agreement
- Makes the logical conclusion obvious

### Technique 3: The Alternative Close

**When to use:** When they're interested but haven't decided on specifics.

**How it works:** Offer two positive options rather than yes/no.

**Script:**

> "So we've narrowed it down to the two-bedroom on floor 12 or the one on floor 18. The 18th floor has better views, the 12th is slightly more affordable. Which would you prefer to secure?"

**Why it works:**
- Assumes they're buying (just deciding which)
- Focuses on details, not the yes/no decision
- Gives them control within a positive framework

### Technique 4: The Urgency Close (Use with Integrity)

**When to use:** Only when the urgency is genuine.

**How it works:** Share a real constraint that creates a decision point.

**Script:**

> "I want to be transparent with you: this unit is one of the last at this price point, and I know [another client/colleague's client] is also considering it. I can't guarantee it will be available tomorrow. Would you like to secure it now to avoid that risk?"

**Why it works:**
- Creates legitimate reason to decide
- Positions you as honest advisor
- Only works if true

**Warning:** Never fabricate urgency. If discovered, trust is destroyed permanently.

### Technique 5: The Trial Close

**When to use:** When you're unsure if they're ready.

**How it works:** Test their readiness with a soft question.

**Script:**

> "If everything we've discussed checks out — the location, the payment plan, the developer — is this something you'd want to move forward with?"

**Follow-up based on response:**
- "Yes" → Move to assumptive close
- "Maybe, but..." → Address the concern, then close
- "Not sure" → More discovery needed

## Handling Last-Minute Objections

### Common Close-Stage Objections

**"I need to think about it"**

> "Of course — it's a significant decision. What specifically would you like to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need.
>
> [Listen for real concern]
>
> Remember, the EOI holds your position while you think, and it's fully refundable. That way you can take your time without risking availability."

**"The price is higher than I expected"**

> "I understand. Help me understand the gap — what were you expecting, and what's the difference?
>
> [Listen]
>
> Let me show you why this is priced where it is compared to alternatives. [Justify value or suggest alternatives within budget]"

**"I'm worried about the developer"**

> "That's a smart concern. Let me share what gives us confidence in [Developer]:
>
> - Track record: [specific projects delivered]
> - Escrow protection: [explain RERA regulation]
> - Our experience: [any direct experience with this developer]
>
> What specifically would give you more confidence?"

**"I should check other options first"**

> "I respect that — you should feel confident in your decision. Can I ask what other options you're comparing this to?
>
> [Listen]
>
> [If you can address] Let me show you how this compares...
>
> [If different needs] That might actually be a better fit for your needs. But if [current property] is right, you wouldn't want to lose it while exploring. The EOI is refundable if you find something better."

## Coach Walkthrough: Closing Scenarios

<speak>Closing is about timing and technique selection. Let me show you when to use each approach. The key is reading their readiness. A close attempted too early destroys trust. A close delayed too long loses momentum. Watch the signals.</speak>

### Practice Scenario 1: Assumptive Close

**Situation:** After a thorough presentation, the buyer says, "This looks really good. I like everything about it."

<speak>This is a clear buying signal. They've given you permission to close. The assumptive close works here because forcing them to explicitly say 'yes' adds unnecessary friction. We're moving past the decision to the logistics. Notice the psychology: I'm treating the decision as already made, which makes backing out feel awkward — but I'm not being pushy, just confident.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Investor: "This looks really good. I like everything about it."

Agent: "I'm glad it fits. It sounds like the 2-bedroom in Building C is the right choice for you. Let me walk you through what happens next. I'll send over the EOI form now — do you prefer to complete it digitally, or would you like me to talk you through each section over the phone?"

<speak>See what happened? I didn't ask 'Do you want to buy?' I asked 'How do you want to complete the paperwork?' The decision point is in the past. We're in execution mode. If they have doubts, they'll surface them now — and that's fine, we'll address them. But most buyers appreciate being guided forward.</speak>

**Your task:** Move naturally to the assumptive close without being pushy.

**Focus on:**
- Confident transition
- Natural language
- Clear next step

### Practice Scenario 2: Summary Close

**Situation:** A buyer has been nodding along for 20 minutes but hasn't said "yes" yet. They've agreed the location is perfect, the price is fair, and the developer is reliable.

<speak>They're in agreement but haven't committed. This is common with analytical buyers. They need to hear their own logic reflected back to them. The summary close does that — it builds a momentum of 'yes' responses that makes the final commitment feel inevitable. Watch how I stack the agreements.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Agent: "Let me make sure I've captured everything correctly. You're looking at this as an investment property, correct?"

Investor: "Yes."

Agent: "And you liked the Dubai Marina location because of the rental demand and established community?"

Investor: "Yes, exactly."

Agent: "The 1-bedroom at AED 1.6M fits your budget, and the 60/40 payment plan works with your cash flow timeline?"

Investor: "Yes, that works."

Agent: "And you're comfortable with Emaar as the developer given their track record?"

Investor: "Yes, they're solid."

<speak>Four 'yes' responses. Now the summary that makes the conclusion obvious.</speak>

Agent: "So you have the right location, the right property type, the right price, the right developer, and the right payment structure. It checks all your boxes. Shall we secure this unit for you?"

<speak>Notice I used 'shall we' not 'do you want to.' It's collaborative, not transactional. And I've built so much agreement that saying no requires rejecting all their own stated preferences. This isn't manipulation — it's helping them see their own logic.</speak>

**Your task:** Use the summary close to gain commitment.

**Focus on:**
- Recapping their agreements
- Building momentum
- Smooth ask for commitment

### Practice Scenario 3: Last-Minute Objection

**Situation:** You're about to send the EOI form when the buyer says, "Actually, I'm not sure. What if property prices crash?"

<speak>Last-minute objections are almost never about what they say. Fear of market crash usually means fear of regret. Your job: acknowledge the fear, provide perspective with facts not feelings, then return to the close. Don't dismiss their concern — that damages trust. Don't overreact — that validates their fear. Stay calm.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Investor: "Actually, I'm not sure. What if property prices crash?"

Agent: "That's a smart question — it's worth thinking through. Let me give you some context.

Dubai property has cycles, like any market. We saw corrections in 2009 and 2017. But here's what's different now: supply is much more controlled, population growth is consistent at 3% annually, and off-plan supply is currently 40% below peak 2015 levels.

More importantly, you're buying in Dubai Marina, which is a mature, established area. These areas have shorter recovery times because rental demand stays strong even when prices soften. And your entry point at AED 1.6M is below the 2014 peak, so you're buying at value, not at peak.

Could prices soften short-term? Yes, markets move. But you're holding for 5+ years based on what you've told me, so short-term volatility is less relevant. The fundamentals — population growth, rental yields, economic diversification — support medium-term growth.

<speak>Now I've addressed the concern with facts, not dismissal. Time to reframe the risk.</speak>

The bigger risk I see is not market timing — it's property selection. We've chosen this unit carefully based on your needs. The location, the developer, the payment structure all reduce your risk. That's where your protection is.

Given everything we've discussed, does this address your concern, or is there something else that's making you hesitate?"

<speak>That last line is critical. I'm inviting them to surface the real objection if this was just a surface concern. Often 'market crash' is code for 'I'm scared to commit.' If there's something else, they'll tell you now.</speak>

Investor: "No, that makes sense. I guess I'm just nervous about committing."

<speak>There it is. The real objection. Not the market — the commitment itself. Now you can address that directly.</speak>

Agent: "I completely understand — it's a significant decision. Here's what gives you protection: the EOI is fully refundable for 14 days. You have two weeks to review the SPA, consult anyone you want, and make sure you're comfortable. If anything doesn't feel right, you walk away with your full deposit back.

The EOI doesn't lock you in — it protects your option while you're sure. Without it, if you wake up tomorrow confident in this decision, the unit might be gone. Does that help?"

<speak>See the progression? Surface objection, factual response, invitation to real objection, address real objection, return to close. This is how you handle last-minute resistance with integrity.</speak>

**Your task:** Handle the objection and return to the close.

**Focus on:**
- Acknowledging the concern
- Providing perspective
- Returning to decision
