MODULE 3.7: Closing Techniques
TYPE: skills-script
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Closing isn't manipulation — it's helping someone who's ready to buy actually make the decision.

Here's the truth: if someone doesn't want your property, no technique will change that. But if someone does want it and is hesitating due to uncertainty, fear, or indecision — that's where closing skills matter.

At Prime Capital, we don't use high-pressure tactics, manipulation, false urgency, or guilt. We do use clear communication, confidence in our recommendations, help with decision-making, and respect for their timeline.

This module teaches you to recognise buying signals — both verbal and non-verbal — and select the right closing technique for each situation. You'll learn five approaches: the assumptive close, the summary close, the alternative close, the urgency close when appropriate, and the trial close.

You'll also learn to handle last-minute objections. "I need to think about it." "The price is higher than I expected." "I'm worried about the developer." Each has a specific response framework.

The philosophy is simple: closing is removing barriers for someone who wants to buy. Your job is to guide them to the decision they already want to make.

### DEMO (3-5 minutes)

**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of closing a buyer who has been nodding along to your presentation for twenty minutes but hasn't explicitly said yes. They've agreed the location is right, the price is fair, and the developer is reliable. Watch how each agent handles the moment of commitment.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: After lengthy presentation, agent waits for buyer to make the move]*

Agent: "So that's the overview. What do you think?"

Investor: "It's good. Very comprehensive."

Agent: "Great. Let me know if you have any questions."

Investor: "No, I think I understand everything."

*[Awkward pause]*

Agent: "So... shall I send you some more information to review?"

Investor: "Sure, that would be helpful."

Agent: "Okay, I'll email that over. Get back to me when you've had a chance to look at it."

*[Conversation ends with no commitment, no timeline, deal stalls]*

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Went Wrong**

Three critical failures. First, never asking for the business — the agent waited for the buyer to volunteer a commitment, which almost never happens. Second, offering more information — when someone has said they understand everything, more information is a delay tactic, not helpfulness. Third, no next step locked in — "Get back to me when you've had a chance" puts all the power in the buyer's hands and virtually guarantees ghosting.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent recognises the buying signals and acts]*

Agent: "Let me make sure I've captured this correctly. You liked Creek Harbour because of the rental demand in the area, the payment plan works within your budget, Emaar's track record gives you confidence on delivery, and the timeline fits your goals.

It checks all your boxes. Do you want me to secure this unit for you?"

Investor: "I think so... but I'm still a bit nervous about committing."

Agent: "That's completely normal — it's a significant purchase. What specifically is making you nervous?"

Investor: "I suppose... what if property prices crash?"

Agent: "That's a fair concern. Let me share some perspective. Dubai property has had cycles — prices fell thirty percent after 2008 and corrected again in 2015. So yes, markets fluctuate.

But here's what's different now: population growth is structural, not speculative. The Golden Visa is bringing permanent residents, not just speculators. And you're buying at sixty percent of the 2014 peak price, so there's less downside risk than buying at the top.

Also, you're holding for rental yield, which continues even if capital values dip. You told me five percent net return on your cash works for you — that doesn't disappear in a price correction.

Does that help address the concern?"

Investor: "Yes, actually. That puts it in context."

Agent: "Good. So, shall we proceed with securing the unit?"

Investor: "Yes, let's do it."

Agent: "Excellent choice. I'm genuinely excited for you — this is a strong investment. Here's what happens now: I'll send over the EOI form in the next few minutes. I'll be with you through every step — the SPA review, completion, and beyond."

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Made It Work**

First, the summary close — recapping all their agreements creates momentum and makes the logical conclusion obvious. Second, asking confidently — "Do you want me to secure this unit for you?" is direct without being pushy. Third, exploring the objection — when nervousness surfaced, the agent didn't dismiss it. They asked what specifically was driving it. Fourth, addressing with substance — the price crash concern got a thoughtful, honest response with historical context and relevant facts. Fifth, returning to the close — after addressing the objection, the agent asked again. Don't leave the conversation open-ended. Sixth, celebrating the decision — "Excellent choice. I'm genuinely excited for you" affirms that they made a good decision, reducing buyer's remorse.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest difference? The strong example asked for the business and handled the objection. Most agents lose deals not because buyers say no, but because agents never ask. And when hesitation surfaces, professionals treat it as information to work with, not rejection to retreat from. Address the concern, then ask again.
