# Payment Plan Comparison

## Why Payment Plans Matter

The same property with different payment plans is effectively a different investment. Payment structure affects:

- **Cash flow requirements** — When and how much capital is needed
- **Opportunity cost** — Money committed to the property can't be deployed elsewhere
- **Risk exposure** — More money committed early = more at risk
- **Total cost** — Some plans include premiums for extended terms

Understanding payment plans is essential for matching properties to investor situations.

## Common Payment Plan Structures

### 60/40 Plan

**Structure:** 60% during construction, 40% on handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 40% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 40% |

**Best for:** Investors who want balanced exposure — meaningful commitment during construction, but significant capital preserved until delivery is confirmed.

### 80/20 Plan

**Structure:** 80% during construction, 20% on handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 60% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 20% |

**Best for:** Investors who want to minimise the handover payment — perhaps planning to finance the final 20% or wanting certainty on remaining commitment.

### 40/60 Plan

**Structure:** 40% during construction, 60% post-handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 20% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 20% |
| Post-handover (12-36 months) | 40% |

**Best for:** Investors with limited immediate capital who can pay from rental income or future cash flow. Often carries a price premium.

### 10/90 Plan (Developer-Financed)

**Structure:** 10% deposit, 90% on or after completion

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| On handover | 90% |

**Best for:** Investors who want maximum leverage with minimal upfront commitment. Usually only offered by developers needing to boost sales — may indicate softer demand.

## Calculating Total Cost

Some payment plans include price premiums. A property might be:
- AED 2,000,000 on a 60/40 plan
- AED 2,100,000 on a 40/60 plan

The extended terms cost 5% more. Whether that's worth it depends on the investor's cost of capital.

### Worked Example: Plan Comparison

**Property:** AED 2,500,000

**Option A: 60/40 Plan (standard pricing)**
| Stage | Amount | Timing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Booking | AED 250,000 | Month 0 |
| 30 days | AED 250,000 | Month 1 |
| Construction (6 payments) | AED 166,667 each | Months 6-30 |
| Handover | AED 1,000,000 | Month 36 |
| **Total:** | **AED 2,500,000** | |

**Option B: 40/60 Plan (5% premium)**
| Stage | Amount | Timing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Booking | AED 262,500 | Month 0 |
| 30 days | AED 262,500 | Month 1 |
| Construction (2 payments) | AED 262,500 each | Months 12, 24 |
| Handover | AED 525,000 | Month 36 |
| Post-handover (24 months) | AED 1,050,000 | Months 36-60 |
| **Total:** | **AED 2,625,000** | |

**The trade-off:** Option B costs AED 125,000 more but requires AED 475,000 less capital during construction.

## Coach Walkthrough: Explaining Payment Plans

This section demonstrates how to explain payment plan options to an investor. Study this dialogue to understand the approach.

### Scenario

An investor is considering an off-plan apartment at AED 2,000,000. The developer offers both 60/40 and 80/20 payment plans. The investor asks you to explain the difference.

### The Conversation

**Investor:** "The sales agent mentioned different payment options — 60/40 and 80/20. What's the difference and which should I choose?"

---

**Consultant:** "Good question. Let me break down both options so you can see what works best for your situation.

First, what these numbers mean: 60/40 means you pay 60% of the property value during the construction period, and 40% when you receive the keys. 80/20 is similar — 80% during construction, 20% on handover.

For this property at AED 2 million, here's how each would look in practical terms..."

*[Pause to pull up or draw the comparison]*

---

**Consultant:** "With the **60/40 plan**, you'd pay:
- AED 200,000 to book the unit
- AED 200,000 within the first month
- Then AED 800,000 spread across the construction period — probably 4-5 payments over 2-3 years
- And AED 800,000 when the property is handed over

With the **80/20 plan**:
- Same AED 200,000 booking
- Same AED 200,000 first month
- But then AED 1.2 million during construction
- And only AED 400,000 at handover

So the key difference is: do you want to commit more money during construction, or hold onto more until you actually receive the property?"

---

**Investor:** "What would you recommend?"

---

**Consultant:** "It depends on a few things. Let me ask: is the AED 800,000 handover payment on the 60/40 plan comfortable for you, or would that require arranging additional financing?"

---

**Investor:** "I could manage it, but it would stretch things. I'd probably need a mortgage for part of it."

---

**Consultant:** "Then the 80/20 plan might actually suit you better, even though it means paying more upfront. Here's why:

By the time handover comes, you'll have already paid 80%. The remaining AED 400,000 is more manageable — you might be able to cover it without a mortgage, or with a smaller one.

The trade-off is that you're committing more capital during construction. You have more money at risk if something unexpected happens — although this developer has strong escrow protections.

There's also an opportunity cost: that extra AED 400,000 you're paying early could be earning returns elsewhere during the 2-3 year construction period."

---

**Investor:** "So what would you do?"

---

**Consultant:** "If I were comfortable with the developer and the project — and I am with this one — I'd probably take the 80/20. The certainty of a smaller final payment is worth more to me than the theoretical returns on AED 400,000 over construction.

But if you have strong investment alternatives for that capital, or you're uncertain about the project, 60/40 gives you more flexibility. You're less committed if circumstances change.

There's no wrong answer here. It's about matching the plan to your cash flow and risk comfort."

---

### Key Teaching Points

Notice what the consultant does:

1. **Explains the mechanics first** — What do the numbers actually mean?
2. **Shows practical amounts** — Converts percentages to real money
3. **Asks about the investor's situation** — Doesn't assume one plan is better
4. **Presents trade-offs honestly** — Both options have advantages
5. **Gives a personal view when asked** — But frames it as preference, not advice
6. **Ends with empowerment** — "There's no wrong answer"

---

## Handling Payment Plan Questions

### "Can I negotiate the payment plan?"

"Payment plans are generally set by the developer, but there can be flexibility — especially early in a launch or towards the end of a sales phase. I can ask if there's any room to adjust the milestone timing. What would work better for your situation?"

### "What if I can't make a payment on time?"

"Most developers have some flexibility for genuine circumstances — perhaps 30-60 days. Repeated delays can trigger penalties or default provisions, which are specified in the SPA. Before signing, we'll review those terms together so you understand the commitments."

### "Is the 40/60 plan worth the premium?"

"It depends on your cost of capital. If you're paying 5% more for the property but that capital would only earn 3% elsewhere, the premium costs you 2%. If that capital could earn 8% elsewhere, the premium is costing you 3%. For investors who need cash flow flexibility, the premium is often worth it."

### "What happens to my payments if the project is cancelled?"

"Your funds are held in a RERA-registered escrow account. If the project is cancelled, those funds are returned to you. The escrow system is specifically designed to protect buyers in this scenario."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Payment plans change the investment** — Same property, different cash flow requirements
2. **No plan is universally better** — Match to investor circumstances
3. **Premiums for extended terms** — Calculate whether the flexibility is worth the cost
4. **Explain in practical terms** — Real numbers, real timing
5. **Ask about their situation** — Don't assume what works for them
6. **Escrow protects construction payments** — Reassure investors about fund safety
