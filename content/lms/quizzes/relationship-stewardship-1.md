    - "Always acknowledge referrals immediately, regardless of outcome"
questions:
  - id: rs1-q1
    question: "When is the BEST time to ask a client for a referral?"
    options:
      - text: "During the property search phase when they're excited about options"
        correct: false
      - text: "Immediately after a successful transaction completion"
        correct: true
      - text: "When they report a problem with the property"
        correct: false
      - text: "On your first meeting to establish expectations early"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The best time to ask for referrals is immediately after a successful completion when the client is experiencing peak satisfaction. They've just achieved something significant and are most likely to want to share that positive experience with others."

  - id: rs1-q2
    question: "A client sends you a message saying 'I really appreciate everything you've done.' What's the most appropriate response regarding referrals?"
    options:
      - text: "Send them a list of five people in their network you'd like to contact"
        correct: false
      - text: "Ignore the referral opportunity to avoid seeming pushy"
        correct: false
      - text: "Acknowledge their feedback and mention that if they know someone considering Dubai property, you'd appreciate an introduction"
        correct: true
      - text: "Ask them directly how many referrals they can provide this month"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When a client expresses appreciation, it creates a natural opening for a referral request. The key is to acknowledge their feedback genuinely first, then make a low-pressure mention that you'd appreciate introductions. This feels natural rather than transactional."

  - id: rs1-q3
    question: "Which of the following is a moment to AVOID asking for referrals?"
    options:
      - text: "At the annual portfolio review meeting"
        correct: false
      - text: "After receiving positive feedback from the client"
        correct: false
      - text: "During a challenging moment such as a transaction delay"
        correct: true
      - text: "Within a week of successful completion"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Never ask for referrals during challenging moments — whether that's a delay, an issue, or any friction in the transaction. The client's experience is compromised, and asking for referrals at this point will damage the relationship rather than strengthen it."

  - id: rs1-q4
    question: "What's the most effective way to make it easier for clients to refer you?"
    options:
      - text: "Ask them to write a detailed testimonial you can publish"
        correct: false
      - text: "Provide them with simple language they can use and something tangible to share"
        correct: true
      - text: "Offer a cash bonus for every referral that converts"
        correct: false
      - text: "Contact their friends directly without asking first"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Clients often want to refer but don't know how to introduce you. Providing simple language they can use and shareable materials (contact info, a brief guide, market overview) removes friction and makes referring effortless."

  - id: rs1-q5
    question: "When a client makes a referral introduction, when should you send a thank-you message?"
    options:
      - text: "After the referred client completes a transaction"
        correct: false
      - text: "Within the same day, regardless of outcome"
        correct: true
      - text: "Only if the referral converts to a sale"
        correct: false
      - text: "At the end of the quarter in a batch acknowledgment"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Thank the referring client the same day they make the introduction, regardless of whether the referral converts. They made the introduction — what happens next isn't their responsibility. Immediate, personal acknowledgment shows you value the trust their referral represents."

  - id: rs1-q6
    question: "Which phrase best exemplifies the Prime Capital approach to asking for referrals?"
    options:
      - text: "I need five new clients this quarter — can you help me hit my target?"
        correct: false
      - text: "If you know anyone in your network who might be considering Dubai property, I'd welcome an introduction."
        correct: true
      - text: "You owe me a referral after all the work I put into your deal."
        correct: false
      - text: "I'll give you a commission for anyone you send my way."
        correct: false
    explanation: "The phrase 'If you know anyone in your network who might be considering Dubai property, I'd welcome an introduction' is low-pressure, specifies the type of person, and offers value to the referred person. It aligns with the Prime Capital voice: confident, direct, but never pushy."

  - id: rs1-q7
    question: "A client indicates they know someone who might be interested. What's the best next step?"
    options:
      - text: "Ask for that person's contact details immediately"
        correct: false
      - text: "Offer to send them a brief email they could forward, or let them give your details directly — their choice"
        correct: true
      - text: "Ask them to set up a dinner meeting for all three of you"
        correct: false
      - text: "Tell them you'll follow up in a few months once you're less busy"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Give the referring client options for how to make the introduction. Offering to send an email they can forward, or letting them share your details directly, puts them in control. Different clients have different comfort levels with how they introduce people."

  - id: rs1-q8
    question: "What should you do if a client hasn't referred anyone after you've asked twice?"
    options:
      - text: "Keep asking every time you speak until they provide a referral"
        correct: false
      - text: "Stop asking and focus on continuing to deliver value"
        correct: true
      - text: "Express disappointment to encourage them to try harder"
        correct: false
      - text: "Reduce your service level since they're not helping grow your business"
        correct: false
    explanation: "One or two asks is enough. If a client hasn't referred after that, continuing to ask will feel pushy and damage the relationship. The best approach is to focus on delivering exceptional service — referrals are earned through value, not persistence."

  - id: rs1-q9
    question: "When a referral from a client completes a transaction, which approach to recognition is most appropriate?"
    options:
      - text: "Post about the referral on social media to publicly thank them"
        correct: false
      - text: "Send a personal acknowledgment and consider a thoughtful (not extravagant) gift"
        correct: true
      - text: "Send them a large cash payment as a finder's fee"
        correct: false
      - text: "Assume they know you're grateful and move on to the next deal"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When a referral converts, send a personal acknowledgment and consider a thoughtful gift appropriate to the relationship. Avoid cash payments (feels transactional), public recognition without permission, or over-the-top gestures that feel like payment for a favour."

  - id: rs1-q10
    question: "According to the module, what is the most important foundation for generating referrals?"
    options:
      - text: "Having a large network of contacts"
        correct: false
      - text: "Asking at the right moments using the right scripts"
        correct: false
      - text: "Delivering an experience worth talking about"
        correct: true
      - text: "Offering incentives to clients who refer"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The module emphasises: 'You don't \"get\" referrals through clever tactics. You earn them by delivering an experience worth talking about.' Excellent service is the foundation — everything else is amplification. Without quality service, no script will generate referrals."
