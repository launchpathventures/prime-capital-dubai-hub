Presenting off-plan properties requires a different approach than ready properties. You're selling a vision, a developer's track record, and a financial proposition — not just a physical space.

Here's the challenge: buyers can't walk through the actual unit, see the finished views, experience the community, or touch the materials. So you must paint a vivid picture, build confidence in the developer, make the numbers clear, and address timeline concerns.

This module teaches you the BUILD framework for structuring compelling presentations. B for Background — establish developer and location credibility before introducing the property. U for Understanding Check — confirm the property matches their discovered needs. I for Investment Proposition — present the financial case clearly. L for Layout and Features — walk through the unit and development. D for Decision Pathway — explain next steps and timeline.

You'll learn to present payment plans with absolute clarity — breaking down booking fees, construction payments, and handover amounts into concrete figures. You'll also learn to discuss ROI projections honestly, building trust through conservative estimates rather than inflated promises.

Sophisticated investors see through aggressive projections. Honesty sells.
