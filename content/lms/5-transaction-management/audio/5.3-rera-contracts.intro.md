Clients are trusting you with one of the largest purchases of their lives. If you can't explain what their contract actually says—what protects them, what they're obligated to do, what happens if things go wrong—you're not advising. You're just processing paperwork.

Here's what every consultant must understand.

First, RERA standardized contracts exist to protect all parties. The SPA isn't just developer-friendly legal jargon. It includes buyer protections: cooling-off periods, escrow requirements, completion deadlines, defects liability. Know these provisions and explain them.

Second, the fourteen-day cooling-off period is real. Off-plan buyers can cancel within two weeks for any reason with minimal penalty. This is a significant protection most buyers don't know they have.

Third, escrow isn't a buzzword—it's the mechanism that keeps buyer funds safe. Money goes to a regulated bank account, released to developers only when construction progresses. Your ability to explain this clearly builds enormous trust.

Fourth, Form F for secondary transactions is legally binding the moment both parties sign. That ten percent deposit isn't just commitment money—it's at risk if the buyer doesn't complete. Make sure clients understand the stakes before signing.

The key takeaway: Contracts protect your clients when you understand them, and expose them when you don't. Read every SPA and Form F before presenting it. Explain key clauses in plain language. Your knowledge here prevents disputes and builds lifelong client relationships.
