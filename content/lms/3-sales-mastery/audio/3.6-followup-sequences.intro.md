The fortune is in the follow-up. Most deals don't close on the first conversation — they close because you stayed present without becoming a nuisance.

Here's the reality: forty-eight percent of salespeople never follow up at all. Twenty-five percent make a second contact and stop. Only twelve percent make more than three contacts. Yet eighty percent of sales require five or more follow-ups.

What this means: most of your competition gives up early. Persistence done right is a competitive advantage. The challenge is following up without being annoying.

The key mindset shift is critical. Wrong mindset: "I need to chase them until they buy." Right mindset: "I need to stay valuable until they're ready." Chasing creates pressure. Staying valuable creates relationship.

This module gives you the complete follow-up sequence from Day Zero to Day Fourteen and beyond. You'll learn the exact timing, the right channels, and the message frameworks that add value instead of just asking for something.

You'll also learn when to persist and when to release — because there's a point where follow-up becomes harassment, and recognising that point protects both your reputation and your pipeline health.
