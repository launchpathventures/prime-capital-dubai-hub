questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What does the 'L' in the LAER framework stand for?"
    options:
      - text: "Learn the objection"
        correct: false
      - text: "Listen completely"
        correct: true
      - text: "Look for signals"
        correct: false
      - text: "Lead the conversation"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The L in LAER stands for Listen completely. Most consultants begin formulating responses before investors finish speaking, missing important information and making the investor feel unheard."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Why should you avoid using the word 'but' after acknowledging an objection?"
    options:
      - text: "It's grammatically incorrect in sales contexts"
        correct: false
      - text: "It makes the sentence too long"
        correct: false
      - text: "It negates everything you said before it"
        correct: true
      - text: "Investors find it unprofessional"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The word 'but' negates everything before it. 'I understand, but...' essentially dismisses the acknowledgment. Pause after acknowledging before providing your response."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What is the primary purpose of the 'Explore Deeper' step in LAER?"
    options:
      - text: "To find weaknesses in the investor's argument"
        correct: false
      - text: "To uncover the real concern behind the stated objection"
        correct: true
      - text: "To gather information for your sales pitch"
        correct: false
      - text: "To buy time before responding"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Most objections have an objection behind them. The stated concern is often not the real concern. Exploring deeper reveals what really needs to be addressed."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Which of the following is the STRONGEST form of evidence when responding to objections?"
    options:
      - text: "Your personal experience with similar investors"
        correct: false
      - text: "Logical reasoning based on market fundamentals"
        correct: false
      - text: "Specific data from authoritative sources (DLD, RERA)"
        correct: true
      - text: "Testimonials from satisfied clients"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Specific data from authoritative sources like DLD, RERA, and bank reports provides the strongest evidence. It's objective, verifiable, and carries institutional credibility."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor asks increasingly specific questions about payment processes and paperwork. What type of objection is this likely to be?"
    options:
      - text: "Genuine concern"
        correct: false
      - text: "Information gap"
        correct: false
      - text: "Negotiation tactic"
        correct: false
      - text: "Buying signal in disguise"
        correct: true
    explanation: "When objections become more specific and practical—focusing on logistics, timelines, and processes—it often indicates serious interest. The investor is mentally preparing to move forward."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What should you do when you feel defensive during a challenging objection?"
    options:
      - text: "Address the investor's tone directly"
        correct: false
      - text: "Pause, breathe, and respond to the content, not the tone"
        correct: true
      - text: "Mirror their energy to show confidence"
        correct: false
      - text: "Redirect to a different topic"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When defensive, pause before responding, take a breath, and remember the objection is about them, not you. Respond to the content of their concern, not their tone."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Which is a sign that you should step back rather than continue addressing an objection?"
    options:
      - text: "The investor asks for more details"
        correct: false
      - text: "Multiple objections are cascading rapidly"
        correct: true
      - text: "The investor becomes quiet"
        correct: false
      - text: "The objection involves pricing"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When multiple objections cascade rapidly, the investor may be overwhelmed or the objection is actually 'no' in disguise. Stepping back gives them space and shows respect."

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What distinguishes a negotiation tactic objection from a genuine concern?"
    options:
      - text: "Negotiation tactics are always about price"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns are asked with genuine curiosity; tactics often feel rehearsed"
        correct: true
      - text: "Negotiation tactics come from experienced investors only"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns never involve commercial terms"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Negotiation tactics often feel rehearsed, focus on commercial terms, and appear at suspicious timing (after significant engagement). Genuine concerns have emotional undertones and are asked with curiosity."
