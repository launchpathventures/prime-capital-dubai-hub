## Success Metrics

### Effective Practice Sessions

- **Maintained brand voice** — Confident, restrained, grounded throughout
- **Addressed client needs** — Listened before advising
- **Navigated objections** — Acknowledged concerns, provided substance
- **Reached objective** — Achieved the scenario goal
- **No pressure tactics** — Never resorted to urgency or aggressive closing

### Red Flags

- Using superlatives ("best in class", "unparalleled")
- Hedging language ("we believe", "we strive to")
- Urgency tactics ("limited availability", "act now")
- Ignoring client concerns
- Rushing to close before building trust

---

## Brand Voice Reminder

Every interaction should reflect Prime Capital's positioning:

> "We move complexity out of sight."

**Voice traits:**
- Confident — We know what we're doing
- Restrained — We don't shout or oversell
- Grounded — Real outcomes, not aspirations
- Direct — Short sentences, clear structure
- Warm — Professional but approachable
- Assured — The right clients recognise quality

---

## Quick Reference

When in doubt:

1. **Trust first** — Does this sound like someone the client would trust?
2. **Clarity second** — Can they understand in one sentence?
3. **Substance third** — Is there real information, not just positioning?
