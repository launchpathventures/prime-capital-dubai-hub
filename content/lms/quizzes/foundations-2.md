## Questions

### Question 1
**It's 6:15 AM. Your alarm goes off. You have 12 unread WhatsApp messages from overnight, including one from a client. What's the correct first action?**

A) Immediately check the WhatsApp messages — the client might need something urgent  
B) Get up, hydrate, and do your morning physical routine first. Messages can wait 30 minutes.  
C) Reply "I'll get back to you" to the client, then go back to sleep for 15 more minutes  
D) Skip the morning routine — it's more important to be responsive  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Starting your day by checking messages puts you in reactive mode immediately. Nothing is so urgent it can't wait 30 minutes. Get up, move, hydrate, and prepare mentally. You'll handle messages during Communication Triage at 7:30 AM — with more clarity and professionalism.

### Question 2
**You open your CRM at 7:00 AM and see that 3 of your 8 active leads haven't been contacted in 7+ days. What should you do?**

A) Leave them alone — if they were interested, they would have contacted you  
B) Send all three a quick "just checking in" message  
C) Triage each lead: schedule follow-up (if viable), move to nurture (if long-term), or mark as lost (if dead)  
D) Delete them from the CRM to keep your pipeline clean  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Leads with no activity need triage, not neglect or deletion. "Just checking in" adds no value. Instead, evaluate each: Are they worth pursuing now? Should they move to long-term nurture? Or should you honestly mark them lost? Action-less limbo is the worst option.

### Question 3
**A client messaged you at 9 PM last night asking for an update on their offer. It's now 7:30 AM. What's the most professional response?**

A) "Hi! Just saw this — let me check and get back to you"  
B) "Good morning! I'm following up with the developer this morning for an update. I'll have information for you by 12 PM today."  
C) "Sorry for the delay! I'll check now"  
D) Wait until you actually have the update before responding  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Response B is professional because it: (1) acknowledges the message, (2) shows you're proactively taking action, and (3) sets a specific expectation ("by 12 PM"). Vague responses ("let me check") create anxiety. Waiting until you have the update means the client thinks you've forgotten them.

---

### Question 4
**When is the best time to do "deep work" — focused tasks like preparing property analysis or client presentations?**

A) Late evening when no one is messaging  
B) Early morning (8-10 AM) when mental energy is highest  
C) Right after lunch when the office is quiet  
D) Whenever you can fit it between client calls  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Your mental energy is highest in the morning (8-10 AM). Deep work requires focus and quality thinking. Protect this time block for important tasks. Don't squander it on reactive work like checking messages.

### Question 5
**You just finished a discovery call with a potential investor. The call went well — she's interested in 2BR apartments in Business Bay, budget AED 1.5-2M, timeline 3 months. When should you update your CRM?**

A) At the end of the day when you have time  
B) At the end of the week during your pipeline review  
C) Immediately after the call — within 5 minutes  
D) When you send her the property shortlist  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Update CRM immediately after every interaction. Waiting until end of day means you'll forget details. Waiting until end of week means critical information is lost. The 2-minute investment now saves 20 minutes trying to reconstruct from memory later.

### Question 6
**What's wrong with sending a "just checking in" follow-up message to a lead who's gone quiet?**

A) Nothing — it's a standard professional follow-up  
B) It's lazy — it puts the burden on the client to generate conversation without providing any value  
C) It's too formal for WhatsApp  
D) It should only be sent by email, not WhatsApp  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** "Just checking in" adds zero value. It says: "I have nothing useful to offer, but please do the work of responding anyway." Instead, follow up with value: a market update, a new listing that matches their criteria, or a specific question. Give them a reason to respond.

### Question 7
**You have a viewing scheduled with Investor B at 2 PM. At 1:45 PM, you realize you haven't reviewed their file — you don't remember their budget, preferences, or what they've already seen. What does this indicate?**

A) Normal — you can't remember everything about every client  
B) A failure of workflow — you should have prep time blocked before viewings  
C) You need a better memory  
D) The CRM isn't working properly  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Walking into a client meeting unprepared is a workflow failure. Block 15-30 minutes before every viewing or call to review the client's file, refresh your memory, and prepare relevant talking points. Flying blind makes you look unprofessional and wastes the client's time.

---

### Question 8
**What percentage of your day should ideally be proactive (planned priorities) vs. reactive (responding to incoming demands)?**

A) 50/50 — equal balance  
B) 30% proactive / 70% reactive — clients come first  
C) 70% proactive / 30% reactive — important work happens first  
D) 100% proactive — never react to anything  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The goal is 70% proactive (working on your priorities), 30% reactive (responding to clients and requests). If you're 70% reactive, you're not controlling your day — everyone else is. Important work never happens in reactive mode.

---

### Question 9
**It's 6:30 PM. You have 15 unread emails and a client just messaged asking about a property. What should you do?**

A) Work through everything — you can't leave things undone  
B) Respond to the client, then quickly clear the emails before leaving  
C) Acknowledge the client's message if urgent, note remaining items for tomorrow, and stop work. Set boundaries.  
D) Log into CRM from home after dinner to finish up  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** 6 PM is the recommended hard stop. Real estate will consume your entire life if you let it. Acknowledge anything truly urgent, note tomorrow's priorities, and stop. Working evenings creates burnout and doesn't improve client outcomes — it just trains clients to expect 24/7 availability.

---

### Question 10
**During your weekly pipeline review, you notice a deal has been "stuck" at the "offer submitted" stage for 12 days with no update. The client, Rashid, hasn't responded to your last two messages. What's the professional approach?**

A) Wait for Rashid to respond — you don't want to seem pushy  
B) Call Rashid directly, acknowledge the silence, and ask if something has changed  
C) Mark the deal as lost and move on  
D) Send another "just checking in" message  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** 12 days of silence on an active offer is a red flag. Don't wait passively or send weak follow-ups. Call directly and address it: "Hi Rashid, I noticed we haven't connected since the offer was submitted. I wanted to check — has anything changed on your end, or is there something I can help with?" Direct communication respects their time and gets you clarity.
