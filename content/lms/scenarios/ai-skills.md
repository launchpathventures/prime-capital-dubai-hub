# AI Skills Practice
## Hands-On Exercises with Google Gemini

**Category:** AI Skills Practice  
**Exercise Count:** 8  
**Competency Focus:** Foundations (Module 0.6)

---

## Overview

These exercises require you to actually use Google Gemini — not simulate using it. You'll complete real tasks, then return here to submit a reflection on what you learned.

**How these differ from other scenarios:**
- No AI roleplay within the platform
- You go to Gemini, complete the task, then come back
- Your reflection is how you demonstrate completion
- Focus on building real skills, not passing a test

**Key principle:** The goal is to build habits and judgement, not just complete tasks. Reflect honestly on what worked and what didn't.

---

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
1. Access to Google Gemini (gemini.google.com or the app)
2. Your Prime Capital Google account logged in
3. A notepad or document to capture your work
4. 15-30 minutes per exercise

---

## AI-01: Area Research & Verification ⭐

### The Task

Research a Dubai community you're less familiar with using Gemini, then verify the key facts.

**Step 1: Choose an Area**
Pick a community you haven't worked with much:
- Dubai South
- Town Square
- Mudon
- Al Furjan
- Dubai Hills Estate
- Jumeirah Village Triangle
- Any other area you'd like to learn about

**Step 2: Research with Gemini**
Ask Gemini to provide:
- Overview of the community (developer, launch date, concept)
- Key amenities and facilities
- Price ranges for 1BR, 2BR, and 3BR apartments
- Target demographic and buyer profile
- Pros and cons for investors vs. end-users
- Any upcoming developments or infrastructure

**Step 3: Verify Key Facts**
Cross-check at least 3 claims using:
- Property Finder or Bayut (for prices)
- Developer website (for facilities)
- DLD or news sources (for infrastructure)

**Step 4: Document Your Findings**
Note which facts were accurate and which needed correction.

### What You'll Learn
- How to structure effective prompts for area research
- The importance of verification before sharing with clients
- Where Gemini is accurate vs. where it struggles with Dubai-specific data

### Reflection Prompts
In your reflection, address:
- Which facts did Gemini get right, and which needed correction?
- What verification sources did you use?
- How would you use this research approach before client meetings?

## AI-02: Email Draft & Refinement ⭐

### The Task

Use Gemini to draft a client email, then improve it through iteration.

**The Scenario:**
A potential client (Dr. Sarah Chen, a Hong Kong-based surgeon) inquired about investment properties in Business Bay. She mentioned a budget of AED 1.5-2M and interest in rental yields. This is your initial response email.

**Step 1: Generate First Draft**
Ask Gemini to draft a professional response that:
- Thanks her for the enquiry
- Demonstrates knowledge of Business Bay
- Asks qualifying questions about her investment goals
- Offers next steps without pressure

**Step 2: Critique the Draft**
Review the AI output. What's missing? What sounds too generic? What doesn't match Prime Capital's voice?

**Step 3: Iterate**
Ask Gemini to improve the draft based on your feedback. Try 2-3 iterations.

**Step 4: Personalise**
Make final edits yourself. Add personal touches the AI can't know.

**Step 5: Compare Versions**
Save your first draft, final AI version, and your personalised version.

### What You'll Learn
- How to give AI effective feedback for iterations
- The gap between AI output and polished professional communication
- Your role in adding the human element

### Reflection Prompts
In your reflection, address:
- How did the email improve with each iteration?
- What did you add or change in your final personalisation?
- How much time did this take vs. writing from scratch?

## AI-03: WhatsApp Message Adaptation ⭐

### The Task

Create WhatsApp messages for different client scenarios, adjusting tone appropriately.

**Step 1: Generate Messages for These Scenarios**
Use Gemini to draft WhatsApp messages for:

1. **Confirming a viewing** — Client: busy executive, viewing at Palm Jumeirah tomorrow at 4 PM
2. **Following up after a viewing** — Client seemed interested in the apartment but hasn't responded in 3 days
3. **Sharing good news** — A unit the client was interested in has just had a price reduction
4. **Rescheduling** — You need to move a meeting due to a conflict, to later the same day

**Step 2: Review for WhatsApp Appropriateness**
Are the messages:
- Short enough for WhatsApp (under 50 words ideally)?
- Conversational but professional?
- Free of formal email language?

**Step 3: Adjust and Finalise**
Edit each message to sound natural and personal.

### What You'll Learn
- How to adapt AI output for different communication channels
- The difference between email and WhatsApp tone
- Keeping AI-assisted messages feeling human

### Reflection Prompts
In your reflection, address:
- What changes did you make to the AI drafts?
