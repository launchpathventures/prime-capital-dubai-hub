# Catalyst — Project Vision Document (v3)

## 1. Project Purpose & Context

Catalyst exists to help teams ship **production-ready outcomes in weeks instead of months** — without losing alignment as AI collapses build time.

Over the last decade of enterprise delivery, the bottleneck hasn’t been “can we build it?” It’s been everything that sits around build:

- Discovery that produces documents, not decisions
- Wireframes that become “the truth” and still need rebuilding into real software
- Translation gaps (workshop → docs → design → build → rebuild)
- Stakeholders seeing the real thing too late, then steering late
- Prototypes quietly becoming production without hardening
- Delivery success depending on a specific person holding context

AI changes the speed of making, but it **doesn’t automatically improve direction**. In fact, when you can build fast, it becomes easier to build the wrong thing fast.

Catalyst is our answer:

- A repeatable **AI-first delivery methodology** (how you run work)
- A practical **development kit** (this repo) that makes the methodology runnable

Catalyst is developed by RIVER Group for our own delivery, and can be used as a
DIY starter kit for your own projects, or as a managed service by RIVER.

## 2. North Star & Desired Outcomes

### North Star
A simple, repeatable delivery system that lets teams prove value quickly and graduate into production safely — while keeping intent visible and decisions durable.

### Desired Outcomes
- Turn a “4 month project” into “~2 weeks” by collapsing translation loops and steering on working proof
- Replace wireframes-as-truth with **proof-led alignment** (wireframes remain optional)
- Make decisions durable via a small set of long-lived artefacts so delivery is repeatable beyond a single lead
- Provide a clear, staged pathway: **Proof → Early Product → Market Ready → Production** (POC → MVP → MMP → PROD)
- Support multiple surfaces (often combined): **web, docs, app, presentation** so stakeholders can understand the story, the decisions, and the proof in one sitting

## 3. Primary Personas & Core Needs

### Persona A — Delivery Lead (agency or enterprise)
**Needs**
- A way to run fast projects that stays defensible under scrutiny
- A method that reduces debate, prevents drift, and makes steering easier
- A reliable path from proof to production without “prototype chaos”

### Persona B — Partner Agency / Small Consultancy (moving beyond low-code)
**Needs**
- A repeatable delivery model that a team can learn, not “hero-led delivery”
- A kit that makes outputs look credible quickly
- A safe path to production so early wins don’t become long-term liabilities

### Persona C — Founder / Solopreneur (moving fast, needing safety)
**Needs**
- Speed without losing the thread
- A way to capture decisions and scope so the build stays steerable
- A staged pathway to harden what’s proven, not everything upfront

*(Designers, developers, and stakeholders are supported by the system, but Catalyst is primarily adopted by people responsible for outcomes: delivery leads and teams.)*

## 4. Decision Principles

- **Speed isn’t the problem; drift is.** Alignment is the scarce resource.
- **Proof beats speculation.** Default to working proof as the alignment tool.
- **Decisions must be durable.** If a decision isn’t captured, it will be re-litigated.
- **Stage the quality.** POC quality is not MVP quality; MVP is not production.
- **No accidental production.** Production is a choice, not an accident.
- **Opinionated, not authoritarian.** Catalyst is suggested steering; teams can override intentionally.
- **Repeatability over heroics.** A new team member should be able to run the system.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** The kit should be obvious for humans and AI to extend.

## 5. Prototype / Phase Success Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — “Workshop to credible proof in a week”
**Persona:** Delivery Lead  
**Trigger:** A client has clear value but the project keeps stalling in translation loops.  
**Steps:** Workshop → stress test → Vision/Architecture/PRD → proof build → live steering → decision on next stage.  
**Success:** Stakeholders interact with working proof early, scope is clear, and the next move (stop / refine / advance) is explicit.

### Scenario 2 — “Partner agency replaces low-code with a repeatable system”
**Persona:** Agency delivery team  
**Trigger:** Low-code delivery is hitting a ceiling (maintainability, constraints, production hardening).  
**Steps:** Adopt Catalyst method → use the kit to ship credible proofs fast → advance validated work into production-ready delivery.  
**Success:** The agency can run high-velocity projects consistently across team members, and the pathway to production is real.

### Scenario 3 — “Proof-to-production without rebuild chaos”
**Persona:** Engineering Lead / Founder  
**Trigger:** A proof is validated and must become a real product.  
**Steps:** Advance deliberately through stages (POC → MVP → MMP → PROD), adding only the hardening work needed at each step.  
**Success:** The project graduates without a full rewrite, quality increases intentionally, and production release is controlled.

## 6. Vision vs Current Phase Scope

### Broader Vision (where this can go)
Catalyst becomes a default system for AI-enabled delivery:

- Repeatable workflows, prompts, and artefacts that preserve intent
- Multiple “surfaces” as standard outputs (narrative + proof) to reduce stakeholder friction
- Clear advancement paths so early proofs can become production without heroics
- An ecosystem of teams and partners adopting the same delivery language

### Current Phase Scope (what this version is responsible for)
Catalyst today focuses on what makes the system runnable:

- A delivery method for POC → production progression
- A small set of long-lived artefacts that keep decisions durable
- Clear decision checkpoints that prevent drift and accidental production
- A development kit that makes it easy to build credible proof quickly

---

## 7. Non-Goals & Boundaries

- Catalyst is not “vibe coding with a nicer starter kit” — it’s fast delivery with steerable decisions.
- Catalyst is not production-ready by default — it is **POC-safe by default**, with an intentional path to production.
- Catalyst is not a replacement for judgement — it’s a structure that improves judgement under speed.
- Catalyst is not trying to solve every infrastructure pattern upfront — it focuses on a clear path, then upgrades.
- Catalyst is not “more process” — it’s less rework, fewer loops, and clearer decisions.

## Maintaining this doc

This Vision is deliberately long-lived. Update it only when Catalyst’s purpose, desired outcomes, primary personas, or decision principles change materially — not for sprint-to-sprint scope or implementation detail.
