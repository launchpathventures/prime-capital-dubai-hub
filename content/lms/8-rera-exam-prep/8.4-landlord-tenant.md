# Landlord & Tenant Law

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **explain** the Ejari system, eviction rules, rent increase calculations, and RDC dispute process—the highest-fail-rate topics on the RERA exam.

---

## Why This Matters

Landlord-tenant questions are where most candidates fail the RERA exam. The rules are specific, the numbers are exact, and the scenarios are nuanced. This module covers every critical concept with the precision needed to pass.

Beyond the exam, this knowledge is essential for advising investor clients about their rights and obligations as landlords, and for helping tenants understand their protections.

## Ejari: Tenancy Registration

### What is Ejari?

Ejari (Arabic for "my rent") is Dubai's mandatory tenancy contract registration system. Every residential and commercial lease in Dubai must be registered with Ejari.

### Why Ejari Matters

- **Legal recognition:** Unregistered contracts have no legal standing in disputes
- **Utility connections:** DEWA requires Ejari for new accounts
- **Visa residency:** Many visa types require Ejari proof
- **Legal proceedings:** RDC will not hear cases without Ejari

### Registration Requirements

To register on Ejari, you need:
- Signed tenancy contract
- Title deed or RERA authorization letter
- Tenant Emirates ID copy
- Landlord Emirates ID copy (or passport for non-residents)
- Payment of registration fee

### Registration Fees

| Transaction | Fee |
|-------------|-----|
| New Ejari registration | AED 220 |
| Contract renewal | AED 220 |
| Contract cancellation | AED 120 |
| Amendment to contract | AED 120 |

### Registration Timeline

| Scenario | Deadline |
|----------|----------|
| New tenancy | Within 60 days of contract signing |
| Renewal | Before expiry of current Ejari |
| Early termination | Within 15 days of termination |

**Exam Trap:** Failure to register with Ejari within 60 days can result in fines and the landlord losing the ability to enforce contract terms.

## Eviction Rules

### The Core Principle

Dubai law heavily protects tenants. Landlords cannot evict tenants at will—specific grounds must exist, and proper notice must be given.

### Grounds for Eviction

#### During Tenancy Term

A landlord can seek eviction during an active lease only for:

1. **Non-payment of rent** — After 30 days written notice
2. **Subletting without permission** — Immediate grounds
3. **Illegal use of property** — Immediate grounds
4. **Property damage** — With documented evidence
5. **Breach of contract terms** — After written notice to remedy

#### At End of Tenancy (Non-Renewal)

A landlord can decline to renew a tenancy only for:

1. **Personal use** — Landlord or first-degree family member needs property
2. **Major renovation** — Requires DLD approval and proof
3. **Demolition** — With government permit
4. **Sale of property** — Only after 12 months ownership

### Critical Notice Periods

**This is the most tested topic on the exam. Memorize these numbers:**

| Reason | Notice Period |
|--------|---------------|
| Non-renewal (personal use, renovation, sale) | **12 months** |
| Non-payment of rent | **30 days** to pay |
| Eviction during lease term (breach) | **30 days** to remedy |
| Tenant giving notice to vacate | Per contract (typically 30-90 days) |

### Notice Requirements

Valid eviction notice must be:
- In writing
- Delivered via notary public OR registered mail
- State specific legal ground for eviction
- Delivered at least 12 months before lease expiry (for non-renewal grounds)

**Exam Trap:** Verbal notice, email, or WhatsApp are NOT valid for eviction notices, even if acknowledged by tenant.

### The 12-Month vs 30-Day Confusion

This trips up most exam candidates:

| Situation | Notice Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Landlord wants to not renew lease (any reason) | **12 months before expiry** |
| Landlord evicting for non-payment | **30 days to pay** (can happen anytime) |
| Landlord evicting for breach during lease | **30 days to remedy** |

**Key distinction:** 12 months applies to END of tenancy decisions. 30 days applies to MID-tenancy violations.

## Rent Increase Rules

### The RERA Rental Index

Rent increases in Dubai are not arbitrary—they're governed by the RERA Rental Index (formerly called the RERA Rent Calculator).

### How It Works

1. Landlord checks current market rent for similar properties
2. Compares to existing rent
3. Applies the increase cap based on the percentage below market

### Rent Increase Caps

| Rent vs Market Rate | Maximum Increase |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 10% or less below market | **0%** (no increase allowed) |
| 11-20% below market | **5%** maximum |
| 21-30% below market | **10%** maximum |
| 31-40% below market | **15%** maximum |
| More than 40% below market | **20%** maximum |

### Calculating Rent Increase

**Example 1: Rent within 10% of market**
- Current rent: AED 90,000
- Market rate: AED 95,000 (5.5% difference)
- Maximum increase: **0%** — rent cannot be increased

**Example 2: Rent 25% below market**
- Current rent: AED 75,000
- Market rate: AED 100,000 (25% difference)
- Maximum increase: **10%** = AED 7,500
- New maximum rent: AED 82,500

**Example 3: Rent 45% below market**
- Current rent: AED 55,000
- Market rate: AED 100,000 (45% difference)
- Maximum increase: **20%** = AED 11,000
- New maximum rent: AED 66,000

### Notice for Rent Increase

| Type | Notice Period |
|------|---------------|
| Rent increase | **90 days** before lease expiry |
| Any contract changes | **90 days** before lease expiry |

**Exam Trap:** If landlord fails to give 90 days notice, the existing rent continues for another year.

## Rental Disputes Center (RDC)

### What is RDC?

The Rental Disputes Center is the judicial authority handling all landlord-tenant disputes in Dubai. It operates under the Dubai Courts.

### RDC Jurisdiction

The RDC handles:
- Eviction disputes
- Rent increase disagreements
- Security deposit disputes
- Contract breach claims
- Property maintenance disputes
- Utility payment disputes

### Filing Requirements

To file a case at RDC:
1. **Valid Ejari** — mandatory, no exceptions
2. **Mediation attempt** — must show good faith effort to resolve
3. **Filing fee** — 3.5% of annual rent (min AED 500, max AED 20,000)
4. **Documentation** — contract, notices, evidence

### RDC Process

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Case filing | Day 0 |
| First hearing | 15-30 days |
| Evidence submission | As directed by judge |
| Judgment | 30-60 days from first hearing |
| Appeal window | 15 days from judgment |

### Enforcement

If a party doesn't comply with RDC judgment:
1. Winner applies for enforcement order
2. Dubai Courts execute (police assistance if needed)
3. Bank accounts can be frozen
4. Travel bans can be imposed

---

## Security Deposits

### Standard Practice

| Property Type | Typical Deposit |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Unfurnished | 5% of annual rent |
| Furnished | 10% of annual rent |

### Deposit Return Rules

Landlords must return deposits within **30 days** of:
- Tenant vacating property
- Final utility clearance
- Property inspection completion

### Deductions Allowed

Landlords can deduct for:
- Unpaid rent
- Unpaid utilities
- Damage beyond normal wear and tear
- Cleaning (if required by contract)

### Deductions NOT Allowed

- Normal wear and tear
- Pre-existing damage (document with photos at move-in)
- Items not specified in contract

**Exam Trap:** Landlords cannot keep the entire deposit without itemized deductions. Tenant can challenge excessive deductions at RDC.

---

## Common Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Short Notice Eviction

**Situation:** A landlord wants to move into their property for personal use. The current lease expires in 6 months.

**Correct Answer:** The landlord cannot evict for this renewal period. They must wait until the next renewal and give 12 months notice.

**Why:** Personal use eviction requires 12 months notice. With only 6 months until expiry, the notice period cannot be met.

### Scenario 2: Rent Increase Without Notice

**Situation:** A tenant receives notice of a 10% rent increase 60 days before lease expiry.

**Correct Answer:** The increase is invalid. The existing rent continues for another year.

**Why:** Rent increase notices require 90 days. At 60 days, the notice is late and cannot be enforced.

### Scenario 3: Eviction for Non-Payment

**Situation:** A tenant is 45 days behind on rent. The landlord served a 30-day notice to pay 40 days ago.

**Correct Answer:** The landlord can now proceed with eviction proceedings at RDC.

**Why:** The 30-day notice has expired without payment. The landlord can now file for eviction.

### Scenario 4: Rent Below Market

**Situation:** A tenant pays AED 80,000. Market rate is AED 100,000 (20% difference). Landlord wants to increase rent.

**Correct Answer:** Maximum increase is 5%, making new maximum rent AED 84,000.

**Why:** At 11-20% below market, the cap is 5%. Even though the property is 20% below market, the landlord cannot jump to market rate.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1

What is the minimum notice period a landlord must give to not renew a tenancy for personal use?

A) 30 days
B) 60 days
C) 90 days
D) 12 months

**Answer: D**

*Explanation: Non-renewal for any reason (personal use, renovation, sale) requires 12 months written notice via notary public before lease expiry.*

### Question 2

A tenant's rent is 15% below the RERA Rental Index market rate. What is the maximum rent increase the landlord can apply?

A) 0%
B) 5%
C) 10%
D) 15%

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: When rent is 11-20% below market rate, the maximum increase is 5%. The 15% difference falls within the 11-20% band.*

### Question 3

How long does a landlord have to return a security deposit after a tenant vacates?

A) 7 days
B) 14 days
C) 30 days
D) 60 days

**Answer: C**

*Explanation: Security deposits must be returned within 30 days of the tenant vacating and completing final inspections.*

### Question 4

Which of the following is NOT a valid ground for eviction during an active lease term?

A) Non-payment of rent for 30+ days
B) Landlord's personal need for the property
C) Illegal use of the property
D) Unauthorized subletting

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: Personal use is a ground for non-renewal at end of lease term, not mid-lease eviction. Mid-lease evictions require contract breach (non-payment, illegal use, subletting, etc.).*

### Question 5

A tenancy contract was signed 90 days ago but not registered with Ejari. What is the consequence?

A) Contract is void
B) Landlord cannot enforce terms in RDC
C) Tenant must pay a fine
D) No consequence until dispute arises

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: While the contract isn't void, an unregistered Ejari means the RDC will not hear any case from the landlord regarding this tenancy. The landlord loses enforcement ability.*

### Question 6

What is the filing fee for a rental dispute at RDC?

A) 2% of annual rent
B) 3.5% of annual rent
C) 5% of annual rent
D) Flat fee of AED 1,000

A) Increase is valid if within RERA caps
B) Increase is reduced by 50%
C) Existing rent continues for another year
D) Tenant can negotiate the increase

**Answer: C**

*Explanation: Rent increase notices require 90 days before lease expiry. At 75 days, the notice is late, and the existing rent automatically continues for the next lease period.*

### Question 8

For what type of eviction can a landlord proceed immediately during an active lease?

A) Personal use
B) Property sale
C) Illegal use of property
D) Major renovation

**Answer: C**

*Explanation: Illegal use (criminal activity, dangerous activities, etc.) allows immediate eviction proceedings. Personal use, sale, and renovation are grounds for non-renewal, not mid-lease eviction.*
