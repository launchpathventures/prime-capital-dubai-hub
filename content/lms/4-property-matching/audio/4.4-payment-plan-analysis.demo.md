**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of explaining payment plan options to an investor. The investor is considering an off-plan apartment at two million dirhams. The developer offers both sixty-forty and eighty-twenty payment plans. Watch how the consultant handles the question "Which should I choose?"

**WEAK DEMO**

*Investor:* "The sales agent mentioned different payment options — sixty-forty and eighty-twenty. What's the difference and which should I choose?"

*Consultant:* "Oh, the sixty-forty is the standard one. You pay sixty percent during construction and forty on handover. The eighty-twenty means you pay more upfront but less at the end. Most people go for sixty-forty, it's the safer option. I'd probably recommend that one. Do you want me to proceed with the booking on sixty-forty?"

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Let's break down what went wrong.

First, vague explanation. "Sixty percent during construction" — but how is that broken down? The investor doesn't know when payments are due.

Second, opinion without understanding. "Most people go for sixty-forty" — but is this investor like most people? We don't know their situation.

Third, no practical numbers. Percentages mean nothing without amounts. What is sixty percent of two million in actual dirhams?

Fourth, rushed to close. "Do you want me to proceed?" — before the investor even understands the options.

The investor leaves confused, uncertain, and probably less trusting.

**STRONG DEMO**

*Investor:* "The sales agent mentioned different payment options — sixty-forty and eighty-twenty. What's the difference and which should I choose?"

*Consultant:* "Good question. Let me break down both options so you can see what works best for your situation.

First, what these numbers mean: sixty-forty means you pay sixty percent of the property value during the construction period, and forty percent when you receive the keys. Eighty-twenty is similar — eighty percent during construction, twenty percent on handover.

For this property at two million dirhams, here's how each would look in practical terms.

With the sixty-forty plan, you'd pay: two hundred thousand to book the unit, another two hundred thousand within the first month, then eight hundred thousand spread across the construction period — probably four or five payments over two to three years — and eight hundred thousand when the property is handed over.

With the eighty-twenty plan: same two hundred thousand booking, same two hundred thousand first month, but then one point two million during construction, and only four hundred thousand at handover.

So the key difference is: do you want to commit more money during construction, or hold onto more until you actually receive the property?"

*Investor:* "What would you recommend?"

*Consultant:* "It depends on a few things. Let me ask: is the eight hundred thousand handover payment on the sixty-forty plan comfortable for you, or would that require arranging additional financing?"

*Investor:* "I could manage it, but it would stretch things. I'd probably need a mortgage for part of it."

*Consultant:* "Then the eighty-twenty plan might actually suit you better, even though it means paying more upfront. Here's why:

By the time handover comes, you'll have already paid eighty percent. The remaining four hundred thousand is more manageable — you might cover it without a mortgage, or with a smaller one.

The trade-off is you're committing more capital during construction. You have more money at risk if something unexpected happens — although this developer has strong escrow protections.

There's also an opportunity cost: that extra four hundred thousand you're paying early could be earning returns elsewhere during the construction period."

*Investor:* "So what would you do?"

*Consultant:* "If I were comfortable with the developer and the project — and I am with this one — I'd probably take the eighty-twenty. The certainty of a smaller final payment is worth more to me than the theoretical returns on four hundred thousand over construction.

But if you have strong investment alternatives for that capital, or you're uncertain about the project, sixty-forty gives you more flexibility. You're less committed if circumstances change.

There's no wrong answer here. It's about matching the plan to your cash flow and risk comfort."

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Notice what made this work.

First, explained mechanics clearly. What the numbers actually mean in practical terms, not just percentages.

Second, showed real amounts. Two hundred thousand, eight hundred thousand, one point two million — actual figures the investor can picture.

Third, asked about their situation. Didn't assume one plan was better. Discovered the investor's cash flow constraint.

Fourth, presented both sides. Explained trade-offs honestly — more capital at risk versus smaller final payment.

Fifth, gave personal view when asked. But framed it as preference, not advice. "If I were comfortable with the developer..."

Sixth, ended with empowerment. "There's no wrong answer. It's about matching to your situation."

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest change: translate percentages into practical amounts and connect to the investor's actual situation. Payment plans aren't abstract — they're real money at specific times. Make it concrete.
