## Question 1

A portal lead enquired about DAMAC Lagoons 3 minutes ago. What should your opening include?

- [ ] A pitch about the project's amenities and pricing
- [x] Reference to their specific enquiry and a question about their goals
- [ ] A request for their budget and timeline immediately
- [ ] Information about your experience as an agent

**Explanation:** The Prime Capital first contact approach references the client's specific enquiry to confirm you're responding to them (not cold calling), then pivots quickly to understanding their needs rather than pitching. Opening with a pitch or aggressive qualification creates resistance.

## Question 2

A lead says "Actually, I'm in a meeting right now. Can you call back?" What's the best response?

- [ ] "Sure, I'll try again later today"
- [ ] "It will only take 30 seconds—this unit is selling fast"
- [x] "Of course. Would tomorrow morning or afternoon work better? I'll send my WhatsApp with some project details in the meantime"
- [ ] "No problem, just call me back when you're free"

**Explanation:** The best response secures a specific callback time (not vague "later"), creates a reason for follow-up via another channel (WhatsApp), and respects their time. "Call me back when you're free" puts the action on them and loses momentum.

## Question 3

What defines the "quiet luxury" approach in first contact conversations?

- [ ] Using sophisticated vocabulary and formal language
- [ ] Mentioning high-profile clients you've worked with
- [x] Confident, unhurried tone with questions rather than pitches
- [ ] Emphasizing exclusive properties and limited availability

**Explanation:** "Quiet luxury" means confident expertise without desperation or pressure. It's characterized by asking questions rather than pitching, respecting the client's time, and positioning yourself as an advisor rather than a salesperson. It's about tone and approach, not vocabulary or name-dropping.

## Question 4

A lead says they're "just browsing" when you call. What's the most effective response?

- [ ] End the call quickly and follow up when they're more serious
- [ ] Emphasize that prices are going up and they should act soon
- [x] Ask what prompted them to start looking at Dubai property now
- [ ] Send them a list of all available properties to review

**Explanation:** "Just browsing" doesn't mean "not interested"—it means they're not ready to commit yet. The best response is curiosity: understanding what prompted their interest often reveals more readiness than they initially expressed. Pushing urgency or retreating both lose the opportunity to understand their situation.

## Question 5

You're responding to a website direct enquiry (someone who contacted Prime Capital specifically, not through a portal). How should this affect your approach?

- [ ] Be more aggressive since they're clearly serious
- [x] Acknowledge they chose Prime Capital and focus on understanding what prompted the outreach
- [ ] Provide more detailed property information immediately
- [ ] Offer a discount since they came to you directly

**Explanation:** Website direct leads have chosen to contact Prime Capital specifically—they're interested in your approach and positioning. Acknowledge this choice and focus on understanding their needs. They're not necessarily more ready to buy, but they've shown interest in an advisory relationship rather than just finding a property.
