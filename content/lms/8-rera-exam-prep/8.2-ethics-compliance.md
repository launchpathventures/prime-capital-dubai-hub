# Ethics & Code of Conduct

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will understand the broker duties and Professional Ethics Charter requirements that form the foundation of the RERA exam ethics section.

---

## Why This Matters

Ethics questions make up 25-30% of the RERA exam. More importantly, ethical violations can result in license suspension, fines, and permanent reputational damage. Understanding these principles protects your career and your clients.

The exam tests specific scenarios where ethical duties conflict or where the "obvious" answer is actually incorrect. This module covers the exact requirements and common traps.

## The Professional Ethics Charter

RERA's Professional Ethics Charter establishes the behavioral standards for all real estate professionals in Dubai. The charter has four core pillars:

### 1. Integrity

- Act honestly in all dealings
- Never misrepresent property facts
- Disclose all material information
- Honor commitments and agreements

### 2. Transparency

- Provide clear, accurate information
- Disclose all fees and commissions
- No hidden charges or undisclosed terms
- Full disclosure of property condition

### 3. Professionalism

- Maintain competence through training
- Follow all regulatory requirements
- Represent the industry positively
- Cooperate with other professionals

### 4. Client Interest

- Put client interests first
- Avoid conflicts of interest
- Protect client confidentiality
- Provide objective advice

## Core Broker Duties

### Duty of Disclosure

**What it means:** Brokers must disclose all material facts that could affect a client's decision.

**Material facts include:**
- Property defects known to the broker
- Legal encumbrances or disputes
- Developer financial difficulties
- Pending regulatory changes affecting the property
- Any personal interest in the transaction

**Exam Trap:** The duty applies to facts the broker *knows or should know*. Claiming ignorance of easily discoverable information is not a defense.

### Duty of Confidentiality

**What it means:** Client information must be kept confidential and not used against their interests.

**Protected information:**
- Client's financial position
- Motivation for buying/selling
- Maximum/minimum acceptable price
- Personal circumstances
- Business plans or strategies

**Confidentiality Exceptions:**

Information may be disclosed when:
1. Client provides written consent
2. Required by law or court order
3. Necessary to prevent a crime
4. Required by regulatory authority (RERA, DLD)

**Exam Trap (Q3, Q9, Q10):** Many candidates incorrectly believe confidentiality is absolute. Know the four exceptions—questions often present scenarios where disclosure IS required.

### Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest

**What it means:** Brokers must not allow personal interests to conflict with client interests.

**Conflict scenarios:**
- Broker has financial interest in a property
- Representing both buyer and seller (dual agency)
- Personal relationship with other party
- Receiving undisclosed payments from third parties

**Required action when conflict exists:**
1. Disclose the conflict immediately
2. Obtain written consent from all parties
3. If consent not given, withdraw from representation
4. Never proceed without disclosure

**Exam Trap:** Disclosure alone is not sufficient—written consent is required. Verbal acknowledgment is not acceptable.

### Duty of Competence

**What it means:** Brokers must maintain knowledge and skills to serve clients effectively.

**Requirements:**
- Complete required continuing education
- Stay current on market conditions
- Understand relevant laws and regulations
- Refer matters outside expertise to specialists

### Duty of Obedience

**What it means:** Follow lawful client instructions within the scope of the agreement.

**Limitations:**
- Cannot follow illegal instructions
- Cannot violate ethical duties
- Cannot exceed scope of authority
- Must document client instructions

## Common Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Client Provides False Information

**Situation:** During a transaction, you discover your client has provided false documentation about their source of funds.

**Correct Answer:** Report to RERA and withdraw from the transaction.

**Why:** The duty to prevent illegal activity overrides confidentiality. Money laundering indicators must be reported.

### Scenario 2: Representing Both Parties

**Situation:** A buyer you're representing wants to purchase a property where you also represent the seller.

**Correct Answer:** Disclose the dual representation to both parties and obtain written consent from both before proceeding.

**Why:** Dual agency creates inherent conflicts. Both parties must be informed and consent in writing.

### Scenario 3: Knowledge of Property Defect

**Situation:** You discover significant water damage in a property you're selling, but your client (the seller) instructs you not to mention it.

**Correct Answer:** You must disclose the defect to potential buyers regardless of client instruction.

**Why:** Duty of disclosure to buyers cannot be overridden by seller instructions. Concealing known defects is fraud.

### Scenario 4: Confidential Price Information

**Situation:** A buyer asks you what price the seller will really accept. You know from confidential discussions that the seller will accept AED 100,000 less.

**Correct Answer:** Do not disclose. This is protected confidential information.

**Why:** The seller's minimum acceptable price is confidential. Disclosing it would harm your client's negotiating position.

### Scenario 5: Personal Interest in Transaction

**Situation:** A property you're showing to clients is owned by your brother-in-law.

**Correct Answer:** Disclose your family relationship before showing the property.

**Why:** Family relationships create potential conflicts that must be disclosed, even if you believe you can remain objective.

## Frequently Tested Concepts

### Fiduciary Duty

A fiduciary relationship means you must put client interests above your own. This includes:

- Acting in good faith
- Providing full disclosure
- Maintaining confidentiality
- Exercising reasonable care
- Being loyal to client interests

**Exam Tip:** When a question asks about "fiduciary duty," think "client first, always."

### Material Misrepresentation

Making false statements about material facts—whether intentional or through negligence—is a serious violation.

**Examples of material misrepresentation:**
- Overstating property size
- Concealing known defects
- Misrepresenting rental yields
- False claims about developer reputation
- Inaccurate completion timeline claims

### Puffery vs. Misrepresentation

**Puffery (allowed):** "This is a beautiful property in a desirable area."

**Misrepresentation (prohibited):** "This property has guaranteed 10% rental yields."

The difference: Puffery is subjective opinion; misrepresentation is false statements of fact.

## Common Exam Traps

### Trap 1: "Best Interest" Override

**Wrong thinking:** "I'm acting in my client's best interest, so I can bend the rules."

**Reality:** Ethical duties cannot be overridden by perceived client benefit. A broker cannot lie, even if they believe it helps their client.

### Trap 2: Verbal Consent Sufficiency

**Wrong thinking:** "The client said it was okay verbally, so I'm covered."

**Reality:** Conflict of interest disclosures and dual agency require written consent. Verbal is never sufficient.

### Trap 3: Confidentiality After Relationship Ends

**Wrong thinking:** "The transaction closed, so confidentiality no longer applies."

**Reality:** Confidentiality obligations continue indefinitely after the business relationship ends.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1

A broker discovers that a property they are listing has unpermitted construction. The seller instructs the broker not to disclose this to buyers. What should the broker do?

A) Follow the client's instructions as part of the duty of obedience
B) Disclose the unpermitted construction to potential buyers
C) Withdraw from the listing without disclosure
D) Report the seller to the police

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: The duty of disclosure requires brokers to reveal material facts to buyers. Unpermitted construction is a material fact that could affect a buyer's decision. The duty of obedience does not extend to following instructions that violate disclosure requirements.*

### Question 2

When can a broker disclose confidential client information without client consent?

A) Never—confidentiality is absolute
B) When it would help close a transaction faster
C) When required by court order or to prevent a crime
D) When the information is already publicly known

**Answer: C**

*Explanation: Confidentiality has four exceptions: client consent, court order, crime prevention, and regulatory authority requirements. Options A, B, and D are incorrect interpretations.*

### Question 3

A broker's cousin wants to buy a property the broker is listing. What must the broker do?

A) Decline to represent either party
B) Disclose the relationship and obtain written consent from the seller
C) Proceed normally since family relationships don't create conflicts
D) Have a colleague handle the cousin's offer

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: Family relationships create potential conflicts of interest that must be disclosed. With written consent from the seller (their client), the broker can proceed. Simply declining or delegating isn't required if proper disclosure and consent are obtained.*

### Question 4

How long must a broker retain client transaction records?

A) 1 year
B) 3 years
C) 5 years
D) 10 years

**Answer: C**

*Explanation: RERA requires brokers to retain client agreements, transaction records, and disclosure forms for a minimum of 5 years.*

### Question 5

A buyer asks their broker what the absolute lowest price the seller will accept. The broker knows from confidential discussions with the seller's broker. What should the buyer's broker do?

A) Share the information to help their client
B) Refuse to answer and explain why
C) Make up a different number to protect confidentiality
D) Ask the seller's broker for permission to share

**Answer: B**

*Explanation: The seller's minimum acceptable price is confidential information that cannot be shared, even when it would benefit your client. The broker should explain that such information is confidential without providing false information (Option C) or seeking inappropriate permissions (Option D).*
