## Handover Prompt — Project Voice Guide
_This prompt helps AI produce a project-specific voice, language, and comms guide._

@AI: You are now producing the **Project Voice Guide** for this project.

**Stability note:** This prompt is intentionally stable. Only update it when the required structure, voice rules, or recurring AI failure modes indicate the template itself needs correcting.

This document defines **how this project should sound** so that humans and AI can write consistent communications and documentation.

This is not a brand strategy document.
This is not marketing copy.
This is a **practical, decision-guiding artefact**.

It should be written for **human stakeholders first** (delivery leads, partner teams, enterprise sponsors), and **technical / AI users second**.

---

## Purpose of the Project Voice Guide

The Project Voice Guide should:
- Make communication feel **clear, confident, and trustworthy**
- Reduce “tone drift” across docs, landing pages, presentations, and product copy
- Help new team members (and AI agents) write like a consistent delivery lead
- Make the project’s claims **simple and repeatable**, without hype
- Ensure internal terminology is translated into **human-first language**

A reader should be able to:
> “Write and rewrite project communications in the right voice — without re-reading chat history.”

## Inputs You Will Receive

You may be given some or all of the following:
- Project name and short description
- Target audience (who needs to trust this)
- The project’s purpose / outcomes (Vision)
- Any known constraints (enterprise, security, regulated, public sector, etc.)
- Any existing language or phrases the team already uses

If inputs are missing, make **reasonable assumptions** and clearly label them as assumptions.

## Required Structure

### 1. Purpose & Context
- What this guide is for (practical comms consistency)
- What the project is (one sentence)
- The core message spine in plain English (e.g. “speed isn’t the problem — drift is” or the equivalent for this project)

### 2. Audience & Communication Goals
- Primary audience (humans) and what they care about
- Secondary audience (builders / AI) and what they need
- Communication goals in priority order (e.g. runnable → trustworthy → clear → detailed)

### 3. Voice (How We Sound)
- English conventions (UK English suitable for NZ unless instructed otherwise)
- 4–6 voice traits (confident, grounded, outcome-first, etc.)
- What we optimise for (outcome first, trust second, mechanism third)
- What we avoid (hype, hedging, technical-first openings, jargon headlines)
- A short “voice checklist” to test any piece of writing

### 4. Message Spine (What We Always Mean)
- The 4–6 step story that appears everywhere (reality → problem → answer → mechanism → outcome)
- A canonical one-liner
- A canonical “why now” line
- A short “practical punchline” list (the rhythm, in human terms)

### 5. Language Rules (Words We Use)
- Preferred terms (human-first language)
- Internal terms that may exist, and how to introduce them gently
- Definitions for any key role terms (e.g. what “project dev” means in this context)
- How to describe relationship to any parent brand/organisation (if applicable)

### 6. Claims & Proof (How We Talk About Outcomes)
- A simple rule for making confident claims without hype
- An “approved proof patterns” list (2–5 sentences/claims)
- A recommended “trust pattern” structure:
  1) Outcome
  2) Reason
  3) Boundary / safety

### 7. Structure Templates (How We Write)
Provide 3–5 reusable templates, such as:
- Overview page template
- “Teach a concept” page template
- Meeting/ritual template
- Start-here CTA block

Each template should be short, scannable, and immediately reusable.

### 8. Examples (Approved Copy)
Write 3 example blocks that can be reused:
- Definition paragraph (docs/landing)
- Partner/team enablement paragraph
- Enterprise / trust framing paragraph (if relevant)

### 9. Language Library (Reusable Phrases)
Provide grouped bullet lists:
- Core phrases
- Value & outcomes
- Trust & safety

### 10. Conversational Moves (How We Progress Conversations)
Provide:
- Outcome-first openers
- 4–6 questions that reduce uncertainty
- Short closers / CTAs

### 11. Visual Guidance (Expressed in Words)
Write practical guidance for how content should *look*:
- scannable structure
- “2-minute summary” behaviour
- short sections
- avoid walls of text
- how to present proof (show the thing)

### 12. How to Use This Guide
- A step-by-step checklist for humans
- A step-by-step checklist for AI agents (what to paste into prompts)

---

## Style & Tone Requirements

- Write in **UK English suitable for New Zealand**
- Plain English, direct and friendly
- Confident and grounded (no hype)
- Outcome-focused (lead with value)
- Human-first; technical details are secondary
- Use short sections, bullets, and clear headings

---

## Final Check Before Output

Before responding, ensure:
- The guide is usable immediately (not theoretical)
- The one-liner and message spine are consistent and repeatable
- There are clear “do/don’t” rules to prevent tone drift
- Humans and AI could write consistent comms without further context

Now produce the **Project Voice Guide** in markdown code.
