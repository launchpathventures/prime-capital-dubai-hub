# SPA & Down Payment

## Introduction

The Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) is the legally binding contract that governs the entire property transaction. Getting this right—reviewing it thoroughly, explaining it clearly, and executing it properly—is one of the most important services you provide.

This module teaches you to handle SPA signing professionally, including how to explain complex terms to clients.

## Understanding the SPA

### What the SPA Contains

A typical off-plan SPA includes:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Parties** | Buyer and developer details |
| **Property** | Unit details, building, community |
| **Price** | Purchase price and breakdown |
| **Payment Schedule** | Installments, dates, milestones |
| **Completion** | Expected date and grace period |
| **Handover** | Conditions and process |
| **Specifications** | Finishes, fixtures, inclusions |
| **Variations** | Developer's right to change |
| **Cancellation** | Rights and consequences |
| **Defects** | Warranty and liability period |
| **Disputes** | Resolution process |

### SPA vs. EOI

| Aspect | EOI | SPA |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Legal status | Preliminary interest | Legally binding contract |
| Commitment level | Can often cancel | Significant penalties for cancellation |
| Detail level | Basic unit selection | Full terms and conditions |
| Registration | None | Registered as Oqood |
| Payment required | Small deposit | Down payment (significant) |

## Pre-SPA Review

### Your Responsibility

Before presenting the SPA to your client, you must review it yourself:

**1. Verify Accuracy**
- [ ] Client name matches passport exactly
- [ ] Unit number is correct
- [ ] Purchase price matches agreed amount
- [ ] Payment plan matches what was discussed
- [ ] Building/community details correct

**2. Check Key Dates**
- [ ] Expected completion date stated
- [ ] Grace period specified
- [ ] Payment schedule dates correct
- [ ] Handover conditions clear

**3. Review Critical Clauses**
- [ ] Cancellation terms and penalties
- [ ] Developer's variation rights
- [ ] Defects liability period
- [ ] Dispute resolution mechanism

**4. Identify Discussion Points**
- [ ] Any unusual or non-standard terms
- [ ] Terms that may concern the client
- [ ] Items requiring clarification

### Red Flags to Escalate

**Raise with developer if:**

- No grace period specified
- Excessive cancellation penalties
- Developer can change specifications without approval
- Payment schedule significantly front-loaded
- Missing defects liability clause

**Raise with management if:**
- Contract significantly non-standard
- Client has expressed concerns about specific terms
- You're unsure about any clause

## Coach Walkthrough: Explaining the SPA

Let me demonstrate how to walk a client through key SPA sections professionally.

### Scenario

**Client:** First-time Dubai investor from the UK  
**Property:** 2-bedroom apartment, Downtown area  
**Price:** AED 2.5 million  
**Payment Plan:** 60/40 (60% during construction, 40% on handover)

---

### Opening the Meeting

**You:**
> "Thank you for joining me today. We're going to go through your Sales and Purchase Agreement together. This is an important document—it's the binding contract for your property purchase. I want to make sure you understand every key term before signing.
>
> I'll walk you through the main sections, explain what they mean in practice, and answer any questions. Please stop me at any point if anything is unclear. We have plenty of time, and there are no silly questions. Shall we begin?"

---

### Explaining the Payment Schedule

**SPA Section:** Payment Schedule shows 60/40 plan with specific dates.

**You:**
> "Let me explain your payment plan. You've chosen the 60/40 option, which means 60% paid during construction and 40% at handover.
>
> Looking at the schedule: your first installment of AED 250,000 was paid at EOI. Today's down payment is AED 250,000, bringing you to 20% paid. The remaining 40% during construction is spread across four milestone payments of AED 125,000 each—roughly every 6 months as the building reaches certain stages.
>
> Then at handover—expected in [date]—you'll pay the final 40%, which is AED 1 million.
>
> One important point: these milestone payments are linked to construction progress, not fixed dates. So if construction runs ahead of schedule, payments might come sooner. If there are delays, they'll be later. The developer will notify you when each milestone is reached and payment is due.
>
> Do you have any questions about the payment schedule?"

**Client:** "What happens if I miss a payment?"

**You:**
> "Good question. The contract allows the developer to charge a late payment fee—typically 1% per month on the overdue amount. If payments are significantly overdue—usually 60-90 days—the developer has the right to send a formal notice. If still unpaid after the notice period, they can cancel the contract.
>
> In practice, developers prefer to work with buyers rather than cancel. If you ever anticipate difficulty making a payment, let me know immediately and we can discuss with the developer. Communication is key—problems usually arise from silence, not from proactive conversations."

---

### Explaining the Completion Date

**SPA Section:** Expected completion Q2 2028, 12-month grace period.

**You:**
> "The expected completion date is Q2 2028—so approximately April to June of that year. The developer has a 12-month grace period, meaning they must deliver by Q2 2029 at the latest without penalty.
>
> What does this mean for you? If the project completes on time or early, great—you'll receive keys sooner. If there are delays within the 12-month grace period, that's considered normal in off-plan development.
>
> However, if the developer exceeds the grace period—so delivery is after Q2 2029—you have specific rights. You can request to cancel the contract and receive a full refund of all payments made. Alternatively, you can continue waiting for delivery.
>
> Dubai's market has matured significantly, and major developers generally deliver within their grace periods. But this clause protects you if something goes wrong."

**Client:** "What if I need to cancel before the grace period?"

**You:**
> "Cancellation before the grace period is different—that's a buyer-initiated cancellation rather than developer default. Let me explain those terms."

---

### Explaining Cancellation Terms

**SPA Section:** Buyer cancellation with 30% forfeiture.

**You:**
> "If you need to cancel—for any personal reason—the standard contract allows the developer to retain up to 30% of payments made as a penalty. So if you've paid AED 500,000 and decide to cancel, you might receive back AED 350,000 and forfeit AED 150,000.
>
> This is why we were thorough in your decision-making process—once you sign, walking away has real financial consequences.
>
> However, there are two important exceptions. First, you have a 14-day cooling-off period starting today. If you change your mind within 14 days for any reason, you can cancel with just a small administrative fee—usually AED 5,000 or so.
>
> Second, if the developer defaults—fails to deliver beyond the grace period or cancels the project—you're entitled to a full refund of all payments.
>
> Does this make sense? Any questions about cancellation?"

---

### Explaining Specifications

**SPA Section:** Specification sheet attached as Appendix.

**You:**
> "The specification sheet is attached as Appendix A. This details exactly what's included in your unit—flooring type, kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, AC system, and so on.
>
> Take a moment to review this. It's important because this is what you're entitled to receive. If the developer delivers something different—a lower quality finish or different brand—you have grounds for complaint.
>
> One clause to note: the developer reserves the right to substitute 'equivalent' materials if their specified brand is unavailable. This is standard, but 'equivalent' should mean same quality level. If you receive something clearly inferior, document it during snagging.
>
> The specification sheet is your reference point at handover. Keep a copy and we'll use it during your snagging inspection."

---

### Explaining Defects Liability

**SPA Section:** 12-month defects liability period from handover.

**You:**
> "After you receive your keys, you have a 12-month defects liability period. During this time, the developer must fix any defects in workmanship or materials—things like cracks appearing, paint issues, plumbing problems, electrical faults.
>
> This doesn't cover normal wear and tear or damage you cause, but any construction defects should be remedied by the developer at no cost.
>
> At handover, we'll do a thorough snagging inspection to catch obvious issues before you accept the property. But some defects only appear with use—a window that leaks during rain, for example. Report any issues to the developer in writing within this 12-month period.
>
> After 12 months, you're responsible for maintenance and repairs, though major structural issues may still be covered under separate warranty."

---

### Closing the Review

**You:**
> "We've covered the main sections of your SPA. Let me summarize the key points:
>
> - Payment schedule: 60/40 with milestone-linked payments during construction
> - Completion: Q2 2028 expected, Q2 2029 grace period deadline
> - Your protection: Full refund if developer defaults; 14-day cooling-off period
> - Your obligation: Penalties for buyer cancellation; payments must be made on time
> - Quality assurance: Specification sheet plus 12-month defects liability
>
> Do you have any other questions before we proceed with signing?"

**After Answering Questions:**

> "I'm satisfied that you understand the terms. Remember, I'm here throughout this process—from now until handover and beyond. If questions come up later, don't hesitate to reach out.
>
> When you're ready, please sign here, here, and initial each page."

## Down Payment Execution

### Payment Process

**After SPA Signing:**

1. **Confirm amount:** Verify exact down payment due
2. **Verify details:** Bank account for transfer OR cheque payee name
3. **Execute payment:** Client transfers or issues cheque
4. **Obtain proof:** Transfer confirmation or cheque copy
5. **Submit to developer:** Payment proof with signed SPA
6. **Confirm receipt:** Developer acknowledges payment

### Payment Script

> "With the SPA signed, we now need to complete your down payment of AED [amount]. The payment should go to [developer name]'s escrow account. I'll send you the bank details now via email.
>
> Once you've made the transfer, please forward me the confirmation immediately so I can notify the developer. They'll confirm receipt and we'll proceed to Oqood registration."
