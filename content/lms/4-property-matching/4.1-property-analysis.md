# Property Analysis Framework

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **systematically evaluate any property against client requirements** using The 3-Factor Property Match framework — enabling you to justify every recommendation with clear reasoning.

---

## The Problem with Gut Feel

Many consultants evaluate properties based on intuition: "This feels like a good fit." The problem is that gut feel can't be explained, defended, or repeated consistently.

When you show a property and the investor asks "Why this one?" — you need a clear answer that connects back to what they told you.

**The Prime Capital standard:** Every property recommendation must include documented rationale using The 3-Factor Property Match framework.

---

## The 3-Factor Property Match

This is Prime Capital's core framework for property evaluation. It examines three factors in sequence:

| Factor | What It Tests | Outcome |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Factor 1: Hard Filters** | Non-negotiable requirements | Pass/Fail |
| **Factor 2: Soft Preferences** | Desired attributes | Score 1-10 |
| **Factor 3: Deal Quality** | Investment merit | Score 1-10 |

**Combined score:** Soft Preferences (weighted) + Deal Quality = Property Match Score

Only properties that pass all hard filters proceed to scoring.

---

## Factor 1: Hard Filters

Hard filters are non-negotiable requirements. A property either passes or fails — there's no middle ground.

### Common Hard Filters

| Filter | Example | Why It's Hard |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Budget | Maximum AED 2.5M | Financial constraint |
| Location | Marina, JBR, or Downtown only | Client requirement |
| Property type | Apartment (no villas) | Lifestyle preference |
| Completion | Ready or within 12 months | Income timeline |
| Unit size | Minimum 2 bedrooms | Family requirement |
| Golden Visa | Must be AED 2M+ | Residency requirement |

### How to Use Hard Filters

Start with your full property list. Apply each hard filter in sequence. Any property that fails a single hard filter is removed — no exceptions.

**Critical rule:** If an investor says their budget is AED 2.5M, don't show them a property at AED 2.7M hoping they'll stretch. You're signalling that you don't respect boundaries.

### The Budget Filter Decision Tree

```
Client budget: AED 2.5M maximum

Property at AED 2.3M → PASS → Continue to Factor 2
Property at AED 2.5M → PASS → Continue to Factor 2
Property at AED 2.6M → FAIL → Remove from consideration
Property at AED 2.8M → FAIL → Remove from consideration
```

**Exception handling:** If an exceptional property is slightly over budget, ask permission first: "I found a property at AED 2.6M that's exceptional. Would you like me to include it, or should I stay strictly within AED 2.5M?"

---

## Investment Goal → Property Type Mapping

Before applying hard filters, map the client's stated investment goal to appropriate property types:

### Decision Tree: What Does the Client Want?

```
PRIMARY GOAL
├── Capital Growth
│   ├── Off-plan in emerging areas (Dubai South, Creek Harbour)
│   ├── Under-valued ready properties with renovation potential
│   └── Developer launches at early-bird pricing
│
├── Rental Yield
│   ├── Ready properties in high-demand rental areas (JVC, Business Bay)
│   ├── 1-2 bedroom units (highest yield per AED invested)
│   └── Avoid branded residences (high service charges erode yield)
│
├── Lifestyle/Personal Use
│   ├── Ready properties in premium locations
│   ├── Amenity-rich buildings
│   └── Larger units, views, quality finishes
│
├── Golden Visa
│   ├── Single property AED 2M+ (most common)
│   ├── Multiple properties totalling AED 2M+ (portfolio approach)
│   └── Ready property required (must be fully paid for visa)
│
└── Portfolio Diversification
    ├── Mix of locations and types
    ├── Different risk profiles
    └── Staged acquisitions over time
```

### Goal-to-Area Mapping

| Investment Goal | Best Areas | Property Type | Budget Range |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Maximum yield | JVC, International City, Discovery Gardens | 1-2BR standard | AED 500K-1.5M |
| Balanced yield + growth | Marina, Business Bay, JLT | 1-2BR premium | AED 1M-2.5M |
| Capital growth | Creek Harbour, MBR City, Dubai Hills | Off-plan 1-3BR | AED 1.5M-4M |
| Golden Visa | Marina, Downtown, Palm | 2-3BR ready | AED 2M-3.5M |
| Lifestyle | Palm, Bluewaters, DIFC | 2-3BR premium | AED 3M+ |

---

## Factor 2: Soft Preferences

Soft preferences are "nice to have" attributes. Properties can score higher or lower, but failing a preference doesn't eliminate the property.

### Common Soft Preferences

| Preference | Weight (1-3) | Score Guide |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Sea/marina view | High (3) | Full view = 10, Partial = 7, None = 3 |
| High floor | Medium (2) | Top 25% = 10, Mid = 6, Low = 3 |
| Developer reputation | High (3) | Tier 1 = 10, Tier 2 = 7, Unknown = 4 |
| Walking to metro | Medium (2) | <5 min = 10, 5-15 min = 6, >15 min = 3 |
| Building age | Medium (2) | <5 years = 10, 5-10 = 7, >10 = 4 |
| Branded residence | Low (1) | Yes = 10, No = 5 |

### How to Calculate Preference Score

**Step 1:** Rate each property 1-10 on each preference
**Step 2:** Multiply by weight
**Step 3:** Sum weighted scores
**Step 4:** Divide by maximum possible score

**Example:**

Property X scores:
- Sea view: 8 × Weight 3 = 24
- High floor: 6 × Weight 2 = 12
- Developer: 9 × Weight 3 = 27
- Metro: 7 × Weight 2 = 14
- Building age: 8 × Weight 2 = 16
- Branded: 5 × Weight 1 = 5

**Total:** 98
**Maximum possible:** 130
**Preference Score:** 98/130 = **75%**

## Factor 3: Deal Quality

Even a property that fits well can be a poor deal. Factor 3 assesses investment merit.

### Deal Quality Criteria

| Criterion | What to Assess | Score 1-10 |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Pricing** | Compared to recent sales and listings | Fair = 7, Below market = 9, Above = 4 |
| **Yield** | Compared to area average | Above avg = 8, Average = 6, Below = 4 |
| **Payment terms** | Flexibility and structure | Excellent = 9, Standard = 6, Inflexible = 4 |
| **Liquidity** | Ease of resale and rental | High demand = 9, Moderate = 6, Limited = 3 |
| **Developer track record** | Delivery history, quality | Excellent = 9, Good = 7, Unknown = 4 |

### Deal Quality Score Calculation

Average the five criteria for the Deal Quality Score (1-10).

---

## The Property Match Score

**Formula:**

```
Property Match Score = (Preference Score × 0.6) + (Deal Quality Score × 0.4)
```

Why 60/40 weighting? Preference fit matters more — a good deal on the wrong property is still wrong for the client.

### Example Calculation

**Property X:**
- Preference Score: 75%
- Deal Quality Score: 8/10 = 80%

```
Match Score = (75 × 0.6) + (80 × 0.4) = 45 + 32 = 77/100
```

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 80+ | Excellent match | Strong recommend |
| 70-79 | Good match | Include in shortlist |
| 60-69 | Adequate match | Include if limited options |
| Below 60 | Poor match | Do not present |

## Building the Shortlist

### How Many Properties?

**Target:** 3-5 properties. More creates decision paralysis. Fewer suggests insufficient work.

### The Ideal Shortlist Structure

| Position | Description | Match Score |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Lead option** | Ticks most boxes, clear frontrunner | 75-85+ |
| **Value option** | Slightly below target but better terms | 70-80 |
| **Stretch option** | Slightly above criteria but exceptional | 70-80 |

### Presenting the Shortlist

"I've selected three properties using our 3-Factor Property Match framework. Let me explain why each made the cut:

**The Lead Option (Match Score: 82):** Marina Gate 2 — This is the closest fit to your brief. It meets all your hard requirements, scores highest on your stated preferences for sea view and developer quality, and it's priced 5% below recent sales.

**The Value Option (Match Score: 76):** JLT Cluster X — This offers better yield (5.8% vs 5.2%) and costs AED 300K less. The trade-off is JLT vs Marina location and lake view vs sea view. If budget efficiency matters, this is worth considering.

**The Stretch Option (Match Score: 74):** Marina Diamond — This is AED 150K above your stated maximum but has a full sea view that commands a rental premium. I included it because the view quality is exceptional. Should I keep it in or stay strictly within budget?"

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Showing properties because they're "good deals"** — If it doesn't match the client's requirements, it doesn't matter how good the deal is
2. **Skipping hard filters** — "They said AED 2M but I'm sure they can do AED 2.3M" loses trust
3. **Not documenting rationale** — If you can't explain why, you shouldn't recommend it
4. **Presenting too many options** — 10 properties = decision paralysis
5. **Ignoring stated preferences** — If they said sea view matters, don't show city view properties

---

## Quick Reference Card

**The 3-Factor Property Match:**
1. Hard Filters → Pass/Fail
2. Soft Preferences → Score 1-10
3. Deal Quality → Score 1-10

**Match Score formula:**
```
(Preference % × 0.6) + (Deal Quality × 0.4) = Match Score
```

**Shortlist target:** 3-5 properties
- Lead option (best fit)
- Value option (best terms)
- Stretch option (above criteria but exceptional)
