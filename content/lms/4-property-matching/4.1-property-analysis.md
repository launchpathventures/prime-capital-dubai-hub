# Property Analysis Framework

## The Problem with Gut Feel

Many consultants evaluate properties based on intuition: "This feels like a good fit." The problem is that gut feel can't be explained, defended, or repeated consistently.

When you show a property and the investor asks "Why this one?" — you need a clear answer that connects back to what they told you.

## The Three-Stage Framework

### Stage 1: Hard Filters

Hard filters are non-negotiable requirements. A property either passes or fails — there's no middle ground.

**Common hard filters:**

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Budget | Maximum AED 3M |
| Location | Marina, JBR, or Downtown only |
| Property type | Apartment (no villas) |
| Completion | Ready or within 12 months |
| Unit size | Minimum 2 bedrooms |

**How to use hard filters:**

Start with your full property list. Apply each hard filter in sequence. Any property that fails a single hard filter is removed — no exceptions.

If an investor says their budget is AED 3M, don't show them a property at AED 3.2M hoping they'll stretch. You're signalling that you don't respect boundaries.

### Stage 2: Soft Preferences

Soft preferences are "nice to have" attributes. Properties can score higher or lower, but failing a preference doesn't eliminate the property.

**Common soft preferences:**

| Preference | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Sea view | High |
| High floor | Medium |
| Branded residence | Medium |
| Walking distance to metro | Low |
| Developer reputation | High |

**How to score preferences:**

Rate each property 1-3 on each preference:
- 3 = Fully meets preference
- 2 = Partially meets preference
- 1 = Doesn't meet preference

Weight your scores based on what the investor emphasised. A sea view might be essential for one investor and irrelevant for another.

### Stage 3: Deal Quality

After filtering and scoring, assess the deal itself:

**Questions to ask:**

1. **Pricing** — Is this priced fairly compared to similar properties?
2. **Terms** — Are the payment terms competitive?
3. **Timing** — Does the completion date align with investor timeline?
4. **Liquidity** — Will this be easy to rent or sell?
5. **Developer track record** — What's the delivery history?

## Documentation Matters

Keep a simple record of your evaluation. When you present properties, you should be able to explain:

- Why each property passed your hard filters
- How it scored on the investor's stated preferences
- What makes the deal quality attractive

**Example documentation:**

```
Property: Marina Gate 2, Unit 1205
Investor: John (Singapore)

Hard Filters:
✓ Budget: AED 2.1M (within AED 2.5M limit)
✓ Location: Marina (preferred area)
✓ Type: 2BR apartment (requirement)
✓ Completion: Ready (immediate rental wanted)

Soft Preferences:
- Sea view: 3/3 (partial marina view)
- High floor: 2/3 (12th floor, 35 floors total)
- Developer reputation: 3/3 (Select Group, established)

Deal Quality:
- Priced 5% below recent comparables
- Previous owner motivated (relocating)
- Strong rental demand in building
```

## The Shortlist Decision

Aim to present 3-5 properties. More creates decision paralysis. Fewer suggests you haven't done thorough work.

**Your shortlist should include:**

1. **The obvious fit** — Ticks all boxes, clear frontrunner
2. **The value option** — Slightly below target but better terms
3. **The stretch option** — Slightly above stated criteria but exceptional quality

Explain the rationale for each: "I've selected three properties. The first is the closest fit to your brief. The second offers better value per square foot. The third is slightly above your target price but worth seeing because of the developer quality."

## What Good Looks Like

**Strong property analysis:**
- Clear connection between investor requirements and property selection
- Documented rationale that can be explained and defended
- Shortlist that offers meaningful choice without overwhelm

**Weak property analysis:**
- Showing properties because "they're good deals"
- Unable to explain why this property for this investor
- Shortlist that feels random or excessive

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hard filters first** — Non-negotiables eliminate properties immediately
2. **Soft preferences score** — Weight based on what the investor emphasised
3. **Deal quality matters** — Even a good fit needs good terms
4. **Document your thinking** — Be able to explain every recommendation
5. **Three to five properties** — Enough choice, not overwhelming
