# Golden Visa & Residency

## Introduction

The UAE Golden Visa program transforms property purchases into lifestyle and mobility assets. For international investors, residency rights often add as much value as the property itself. Understanding the program thoroughly—and communicating it effectively—is essential.

## Golden Visa Overview

### What Is the Golden Visa?

The Golden Visa is a long-term residency visa (10 years) that allows non-UAE nationals to live, work, and study in the UAE without requiring a national sponsor.

**Key Benefits**:
- 10-year renewable residency
- No sponsor requirement
- 100% business ownership in mainland
- Multiple entries without restriction
- Family sponsorship included
- No minimum stay requirement
- Available for property investors meeting threshold

### Property Investment Route

**Threshold**: AED 2 million property value

**Requirements**:
- Property must be completed (not off-plan)
- Must be owned fully (no mortgage) OR
- Mortgage value must not exceed 50% of property value
- Property must be residential

**Important Clarification**: The AED 2M threshold is based on **property value**, not purchase price. RERA valuation confirms eligibility.

## Eligibility Details

### Property Value Calculation

| Scenario | Golden Visa Eligible? |
|----------|----------------------|
| AED 2.5M property, no mortgage | ✅ Yes |
| AED 2.5M property, AED 1M mortgage | ✅ Yes (equity > AED 2M) |
| AED 2M property, AED 500K mortgage | ✅ Yes (equity = AED 1.5M + property value > AED 2M) |
| AED 1.8M property | ❌ No (below threshold) |
| Off-plan property AED 3M | ❌ No (must be completed) |
| Multiple properties totaling AED 2M+ | ✅ Yes (can combine) |

### Joint Ownership

- **Married couples**: Joint ownership eligible—both can obtain Golden Visa
- **Unmarried partners**: Generally, single ownership with one visa holder
- **Multiple investors**: Each investor needs to meet threshold individually

### Off-Plan Considerations

Off-plan properties do **not** qualify for Golden Visa until:
- Construction is complete
- Title deed is issued
- Property is handed over

**Strategy**: Clients purchasing off-plan for Golden Visa purposes should plan timeline accordingly. Consider purchasing completed property for immediate visa if residency is time-sensitive.

## Application Process

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Property Purchase**: Complete purchase and receive title deed
2. **RERA Valuation**: Obtain property valuation confirming AED 2M+ value
3. **Documentation Gathering**:
   - Passport copy
   - Title deed
   - RERA valuation certificate
   - Health insurance
   - Passport photos
4. **Medical Examination**: Emirates ID medical screening
5. **Application Submission**: Through ICP (Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship)
6. **Visa Stamping**: Once approved, visa stamped in passport
7. **Emirates ID**: Biometrics and ID card issuance

### Timeline

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Documentation preparation | 1-2 weeks |
| Application submission | 1 day |
| Medical and Emirates ID | 2-3 days |
| Approval | 2-4 weeks |
| **Total** | **4-6 weeks** |

### Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|

| Emirates ID | AED 370 (10 years) |
| Medical | AED 300-500 |
| RERA valuation | AED 2,500-4,000 |
| Health insurance | Variable (mandatory) |
| **Total** | **AED 5,000-7,000** |

## Family Sponsorship

### Who Can Be Sponsored?

Golden Visa holders can sponsor:
- **Spouse**: Unlimited age
- **Children**: 
  - Sons up to age 25 (extended from 18)
  - Daughters (unmarried, any age)
  - Special needs dependents (any age)
- **Parents**: Under certain conditions

### Family Application

Family members receive same 10-year visa duration and can:
- Live in UAE
- Study at any institution
- Work (with separate work permit)
- Travel freely

### Domestic Staff

Golden Visa holders can sponsor:
- Domestic workers (maids, drivers)
- Up to 3 domestic staff typically permitted

## Benefits Deep-Dive

### Business Benefits

**100% Ownership**: Golden Visa holders can own businesses in mainland UAE without local partner or free zone restriction.

**Professional Practice**: Licensed professionals can practice independently.

**Banking Access**: Full access to UAE banking services, investment accounts.

### Lifestyle Benefits

**No Minimum Stay**: Unlike some residency programs, no requirement to spend specific days in UAE.

**Education Access**: Children can attend any school in UAE (public or private).

**Healthcare Access**: Full access to UAE healthcare system with insurance.

### Tax Considerations

**Important**: Golden Visa provides *residency*, not automatic *tax residency*. Tax status depends on:
- Time spent in UAE
- Ties to home country
- Tax treaties
- Individual circumstances

**Recommendation**: Clients should consult tax professionals regarding their specific situation. Prime Capital provides connections but not tax advice.

## Coach Walkthrough: Golden Visa Conversations

### Scenario 1: Explaining the Program

**Context**: Client asks about Golden Visa while discussing property purchase

**Approach**:
1. Confirm their interest level
2. Explain threshold and requirements clearly
3. Connect to their specific situation
4. Clarify what it does and doesn't include

**Example Script**:

> "The Golden Visa is one of the most valuable aspects of Dubai property investment for international buyers. Here's how it works:
>
> If you purchase completed property worth AED 2 million or more, you're eligible for a 10-year renewable residency visa. This lets you live, work, and do business in the UAE without needing a local sponsor.
>
> The key requirements: the property needs to be completed—not off-plan—and titled in your name. If you have a mortgage, you need at least 50% equity.
>
> The visa extends to your family too—spouse and children can be included on the same application.
>
> Is residency something you're specifically interested in, or are you mainly focused on the investment itself? That helps me understand which properties might make the most sense for you."

### Scenario 2: Addressing Misconceptions

**Context**: Client believes off-plan purchase qualifies immediately

**Approach**:
1. Gently correct the misconception
2. Explain the actual requirement
3. Present options that meet their timeline
4. Avoid making them feel wrong

**Example Script**:

> "I want to clarify one detail about Golden Visa timing—it's a common area of confusion.
>
> The visa eligibility kicks in when you have the title deed for a completed property. With off-plan, you'll get the visa once the project is finished and handed over—which could be 2-3 years depending on the project.
>
> If you need residency sooner, there are two options: you could look at completed properties that already meet the threshold, or you could secure the off-plan now for the investment value and apply for Golden Visa at handover.
>
> What's your timeline for wanting the residency sorted? That'll help us figure out the right approach."

### Scenario 3: Positioning Residency Value

**Context**: Client is comparing Dubai to other markets and weighing value

**Approach**:
1. Quantify the residency benefit
2. Compare to other programs
3. Connect to their specific needs
4. Avoid overselling

**Example Script**:

> "When comparing Dubai to other markets, the residency component is worth factoring in.
>
> A 10-year visa that allows you to live, work, and do business here—plus sponsor your family—has real value. Some clients have told me they'd pay $200,000+ just for that access if it were sold separately.
>
> Compare that to Portugal's Golden Visa, which has become much more restrictive, or programs requiring significantly higher minimums.
>
> Of course, this only matters if residency is useful to you. If you're purely focused on financial returns and wouldn't use the UAE as a base, then it's a nice extra rather than a driver. What role does having a Dubai presence play in your thinking?"

## Common Questions and Answers

### "Can I get Golden Visa with off-plan property?"

**Answer**: Not until the property is completed and you have the title deed. If residency is time-sensitive, consider completed property or plan your timeline around expected handover.

### "What if my property value drops below AED 2M?"

**Answer**: Eligibility is assessed at application. Once granted, the visa is for 10 years regardless of subsequent market movements. At renewal, current value would be reassessed.

### "Can I work in the UAE on Golden Visa?"

**Answer**: Yes, Golden Visa allows you to work. You would still need appropriate work permits for certain professions, but the visa itself is not employment-restricted.

### "What about taxes—am I tax-free?"

**Answer**: The UAE has no personal income tax, but tax *residency* is separate from *visa residency*. Your tax obligations depend on where you spend time and your home country's rules. I'd recommend consulting a tax professional for your specific situation.

### "Can my parents get Golden Visa too?"

**Answer**: You can sponsor parents on dependent visas, but they don't automatically get Golden Visa. Parent sponsorship has separate requirements and typically shorter visa durations.

### "How long does renewal take?"

**Answer**: Renewal is straightforward if you still own qualifying property. Process takes 2-4 weeks and property value is reassessed at that time.

## Other Residency Options

### Property Owner Visa (Under AED 2M)

For properties below AED 2M threshold:
- 2-year renewable visa available
- Requires property ownership
- Less comprehensive than Golden Visa
- Good option for lower-value investments

### Retirement Visa

For individuals 55+:
- Property investment option: AED 1M property
- Or: AED 1M in savings
- Or: AED 20,000+ monthly income
- 5-year renewable visa

### Investor Visa (Business)

For business investors:
- AED 2M business investment
- 10-year Golden Visa
- Separate from property route

## Key Takeaways

1. **AED 2M threshold**: Property value (not purchase price) must meet this for Golden Visa eligibility

2. **Completed property required**: Off-plan properties don't qualify until handover

3. **10-year renewable**: The visa provides genuine long-term residency

4. **Family included**: Spouse and children can be sponsored

5. **Real value-add**: Residency rights significantly enhance property investment value for international buyers

6. **Not tax advice**: Residency and tax residency are different—clients should seek professional tax guidance
