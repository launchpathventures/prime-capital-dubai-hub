# Payment Plan Comparison

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **compare payment plans using The Payment Plan Calculator** and confidently explain which plan fits an investor's situation — with actual math, not generalities.

---

## Why Payment Plans Matter

The same property with different payment plans is effectively a different investment. Payment structure affects:

- **Cash flow requirements** — When and how much capital is needed
- **Opportunity cost** — Money committed to the property can't be deployed elsewhere
- **Risk exposure** — More money committed early = more at risk
- **Total cost** — Some plans include premiums for extended terms
- **ROI on capital deployed** — Different plans mean different returns

Understanding payment plans is essential for matching properties to investor situations.

---

## The Payment Plan Calculator

The Payment Plan Calculator evaluates four metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Capital Deployed** | Money committed over time | Cash flow planning |
| **Opportunity Cost** | Returns forgone on committed capital | True cost comparison |
| **Risk Exposure** | Capital at risk if project fails | Risk management |
| **ROI on Deployed Capital** | Return relative to cash actually invested | Investment efficiency |

---

## Common Payment Plan Structures

### 60/40 Plan (Most Common)

**Structure:** 60% during construction, 40% on handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 40% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 40% |

**Best for:** Investors who want balanced exposure — meaningful commitment during construction, but significant capital preserved until delivery is confirmed.

### 80/20 Plan

**Structure:** 80% during construction, 20% on handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 60% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 20% |

**Best for:** Investors who want to minimise the handover payment — perhaps planning to finance the final 20% or wanting certainty on remaining commitment.

### 40/60 Plan (Post-Handover)

**Structure:** 40% during construction, 60% post-handover

**Typical breakdown:**
| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| Within 30 days | 10% |
| During construction | 20% (in instalments) |
| On handover | 20% |
| Post-handover (12-36 months) | 40% |

**Best for:** Investors with limited immediate capital who can pay from rental income or future cash flow. Often carries a price premium (typically 5-8%).

### 10/90 Plan (Developer-Financed)

**Structure:** 10% deposit, 90% on or after completion

| Stage | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Booking | 10% |
| On handover | 90% |

**Best for:** Investors who want maximum leverage with minimal upfront commitment. Usually only offered by developers needing to boost sales — may indicate softer demand or inventory clearing.

### 60/40 Plan Analysis

| Timeline | Payment | Cumulative Capital Deployed |
|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Month 0 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 200,000 |
| Month 1 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 400,000 |

|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Month 0 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 200,000 |
| Month 1 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 400,000 |
| Month 6 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 600,000 |
| Month 12 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 800,000 |
| Month 18 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 1,000,000 |
| Month 24 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 1,200,000 |
| Month 30 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 1,400,000 |
| Month 36 | AED 200,000 (10%) | AED 1,600,000 |
| Handover | AED 400,000 (20%) | AED 2,000,000 |

**Average capital deployed over 3 years:** AED 900,000
**Maximum risk during construction:** AED 1,600,000

### 40/60 Plan Analysis (with 5% premium)

**Total price:** AED 2,100,000

| Timeline | Payment | Cumulative Capital Deployed |
|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Month 0 | AED 210,000 (10%) | AED 210,000 |
| Month 1 | AED 210,000 (10%) | AED 420,000 |
| Month 18 | AED 210,000 (10%) | AED 630,000 |
| Month 36 | AED 210,000 (10%) | AED 840,000 |
| Handover + 12 | AED 420,000 (20%) | AED 1,260,000 |
| Handover + 24 | AED 420,000 (20%) | AED 1,680,000 |
| Handover + 36 | AED 420,000 (20%) | AED 2,100,000 |

**Average capital deployed over 3 years:** AED 500,000
**Maximum risk during construction:** AED 840,000

## ROI Comparison by Payment Plan

Assume the property appreciates 20% over the 3-year construction period (AED 400,000 gain on AED 2,000,000):

| Plan | Capital at Risk | Handover Value | Gain | 3-Year ROI on Capital |
|------|-----------------|----------------|------|---------------------|
| 60/40 | AED 1,200,000 | AED 2,400,000 | AED 400,000 | 33% |
| 80/20 | AED 1,600,000 | AED 2,400,000 | AED 400,000 | 25% |
| 40/60 | AED 840,000 | AED 2,400,000 | AED 300,000* | 36% |

*40/60 gain is AED 300,000 because of the AED 100,000 premium paid.

**Key insight:** Lower upfront commitment = higher ROI on capital deployed (leverage effect), but lower absolute gain and additional premium cost.

**Note:** These are 3-year total returns, not annualised. 60/40's 33% over 3 years equals approximately 10% annualised.

## The Plan Selector Matrix

Match payment plan to investor situation:

| Investor Situation | Recommended Plan | Why |
|-------------------|------------------|-----|
| Has full capital, wants certainty | 60/40 or 80/20 | Lower total cost, no premium |
| Limited capital, strong future income | 40/60 | Lower upfront, pay from rent |
| Wants maximum leverage | 10/90 | Minimal commitment, but check developer |
| Risk-averse, Tier 1 developer | 80/20 | Lower handover pressure |
| Diversifying across properties | 40/60 or 60/40 | Preserve capital for other purchases |
| Needs handover flexibility | 60/40 | Balance between commitment and reserve |

---

## Opportunity Cost Calculation

**Scenario:** Investor has AED 1,500,000 available

**Question:** Should they take 60/40 plan (deploy AED 1,200,000 during construction) or 40/60 plan (deploy AED 840,000 during construction)?

**60/40 Plan:**
- Capital deployed: AED 1,200,000
- Capital remaining for investment: AED 300,000
- If remaining capital earns 6%/year: AED 18,000/year × 3 years = AED 54,000

**40/60 Plan:**
- Capital deployed: AED 840,000
- Capital remaining for investment: AED 660,000
- If remaining capital earns 6%/year: AED 39,600/year × 3 years = AED 118,800
- But pay AED 100,000 premium for plan

**Net comparison:**
- 60/40: Save AED 0 premium, earn AED 54,000 = Net benefit AED 54,000
- 40/60: Pay AED 100,000 premium, earn AED 118,800 = Net benefit AED 18,800

**Conclusion:** At 6% return on capital, 60/40 is better. The extra earnings (AED 64,800) don't cover the premium (AED 100,000).

**Break-even calculation:** The extra preserved capital is AED 360,000. To offset the AED 100,000 premium over 3 years, you need: 100,000 / (360,000 × 3) = 9.3% annual return. At anything above ~9% annual return, 40/60 becomes worthwhile.

## Coach Walkthrough: Explaining Payment Plans

This section demonstrates how to explain payment plan options to an investor. Study this dialogue to understand the approach.

### Scenario

An investor is considering an off-plan apartment at AED 2,000,000. The developer offers both 60/40 and 80/20 payment plans. The investor asks you to explain the difference.

### The Conversation

**Investor:** "The sales agent mentioned different payment options — 60/40 and 80/20. What's the difference and which should I choose?"

---

**Consultant:** "Good question. Let me break down both options using The Payment Plan Calculator so you can see exactly what works best for your situation.

First, what these numbers mean: 60/40 means you pay 60% of the property value during the construction period, and 40% when you receive the keys. 80/20 is similar — 80% during construction, 20% on handover.

For this property at AED 2 million, here's how each would look in practical terms..."

*[Pause to pull up or draw the comparison]*

---

**Consultant:** "With the **60/40 plan**, you'd pay:
- AED 200,000 to book the unit
- AED 200,000 within the first month
- Then AED 800,000 spread across the construction period — probably 4-5 payments over 2-3 years
- And AED 800,000 when the property is handed over

With the **80/20 plan**:
- Same AED 200,000 booking
- Same AED 200,000 first month
- But then AED 1.2 million during construction
- And only AED 400,000 at handover

So the key difference is: do you want to commit more money during construction, or hold onto more until you actually receive the property?"

---

**Investor:** "What would you recommend?"

---

**Consultant:** "It depends on a few things. Let me ask: is the AED 800,000 handover payment on the 60/40 plan comfortable for you, or would that require arranging additional financing?"

---

**Investor:** "I could manage it, but it would stretch things. I'd probably need a mortgage for part of it."

---

**Consultant:** "Then the 80/20 plan might actually suit you better, even though it means paying more upfront. Here's why:

By the time handover comes, you'll have already paid 80%. The remaining AED 400,000 is more manageable — you might be able to cover it without a mortgage, or with a smaller one.

The trade-off is that you're committing more capital during construction. You have more money at risk if something unexpected happens — although this developer has strong escrow protections.

There's also an opportunity cost: that extra AED 400,000 you're paying early could be earning returns elsewhere during the 2-3 year construction period."

---

**Investor:** "So what would you do?"

---

**Consultant:** "If I were comfortable with the developer and the project — and I am with this one — I'd probably take the 80/20. The certainty of a smaller final payment is worth more to me than the theoretical returns on AED 400,000 over construction.

But if you have strong investment alternatives for that capital, or you're uncertain about the project, 60/40 gives you more flexibility. You're less committed if circumstances change.

There's no wrong answer here. It's about matching the plan to your cash flow and risk comfort."

---

### Key Teaching Points

Notice what the consultant does:

1. **Explains the mechanics first** — What do the numbers actually mean?
2. **Shows practical amounts** — Converts percentages to real money
3. **Asks about the investor's situation** — Doesn't assume one plan is better
4. **Presents trade-offs honestly** — Both options have advantages
5. **Gives a personal view when asked** — But frames it as preference, not advice
6. **Ends with empowerment** — "There's no wrong answer"

---

## Handling Payment Plan Questions

### "Can I negotiate the payment plan?"

"Payment plans are generally set by the developer, but there can be flexibility — especially early in a launch or towards the end of a sales phase. I can ask if there's any room to adjust the milestone timing. What would work better for your situation?"

### "What if I can't make a payment on time?"

"Most developers have some flexibility for genuine circumstances — perhaps 30-60 days. Repeated delays can trigger penalties or default provisions, which are specified in the SPA. Before signing, we'll review those terms together so you understand the commitments."

### "Is the 40/60 plan worth the premium?"

"It depends on your cost of capital. If you're paying 5% more for the property but that capital would only earn 3% elsewhere, the premium costs you 2%. If that capital could earn 8% elsewhere, the premium is costing you 3%. For investors who need cash flow flexibility, the premium is often worth it."

### "What happens to my payments if the project is cancelled?"

"Your funds are held in a RERA-registered escrow account. If the project is cancelled, those funds are returned to you. The escrow system is specifically designed to protect buyers in this scenario."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use The Payment Plan Calculator** — Don't guess; calculate capital deployed, opportunity cost, and ROI
2. **Payment plans change the investment** — Same property, different cash flow and returns
3. **No plan is universally better** — Use the Plan Selector Matrix to match to investor situation
4. **Premiums need justification** — Calculate break-even: is the capital return > premium cost?
5. **Explain in practical terms** — Real AED amounts, real timeline, real monthly impact
6. **Ask about their situation** — Income timing, other investments, risk tolerance
7. **Escrow protects construction payments** — Always verify RERA registration

## Quick Reference Card

**Common payment plans:**
| Plan | During Construction | On Handover |
|------|--------------------:|------------:|
| 60/40 | 60% | 40% |
| 80/20 | 80% | 20% |
| 40/60 | 40% | 20% + 40% post |
| 10/90 | 10% | 90% |

**Plan Selector quick guide:**
- Full capital available → 60/40 or 80/20
- Limited capital now → 40/60 (accept premium)
- Maximum leverage → 10/90 (check developer)
- Risk-averse → 80/20 (lower handover)

**Premium break-even formula:**
```
Break-even return = Premium % / Years to handover
Example: 5% premium over 3 years = need 1.67%+ return/year
```

**Key questions to ask:**
- What capital do you have available now?
- Where would unused capital be invested?
- How important is handover certainty?
- Are you comfortable with construction-period risk?
