**CONTEXT**

Every follow-up either strengthens or weakens your relationship. The goal is to stay relevant and helpful without becoming a nuisance. This skill is what separates consultants who build long-term practices from those who burn through leads.

**THE PROCESS**

There are four core principles to strategic follow-up.

**Principle one: Add value, not pressure.** Every follow-up should give something, not ask for something.

Value-adding follow-ups include market updates relevant to their interests, new properties matching their criteria, answers to questions they asked, or invitations to events.

Pressure-adding follow-ups to avoid: "Just checking in," "Any update on your decision?", "Don't want you to miss this opportunity," or creating false urgency about prices going up.

**Principle two: Respect stated timelines.** If an investor says "I'll know in two weeks," don't contact them after three days. Wait at least two weeks.

The exception: if something genuinely changes—a new property that exactly matches their needs, a significant market development—a brief note is appropriate. "I know you said two weeks, but I wanted you to see this. Happy to discuss when you're ready."

**Principle three: Match energy to engagement.** If an investor is engaged—responding quickly, asking follow-up questions, showing enthusiasm—match that energy with prompt, substantive follow-up.

If an investor is distant—slow responses, brief replies, declining engagement—dial back. Less is more when energy is low.

**Principle four: Create exit ramps.** Make it easy for investors to step away without awkwardness.

For example: "If your circumstances have changed or this isn't the right time, no problem at all. Just let me know and I'll stop following up. Happy to reconnect in the future if it makes sense."

This isn't giving up. It's showing respect. Investors who aren't right for now may return later.

**Adjust cadence by stage.** During active evaluation—high engagement—respond within 24 hours, proactive outreach 2-3 times per week. During consideration—medium engagement—weekly check-ins with value content. When dormant—low engagement—monthly touchpoints maximum, focus on genuinely interesting content.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, "just checking in" messages. These add nothing and feel like pestering. Always include something of value.

Second, ignoring stated timelines. If they said two weeks, wait two weeks. Premature follow-up signals you weren't listening.

Third, continuing to chase after clear soft rejection. Multiple unanswered messages, shorter responses, new objections every time—these are signals to step back gracefully.

**PRO TIP**

Play the long game. Keep detailed notes on investor preferences and circumstances. Share useful content that keeps you in mind without asking for anything. Be genuinely helpful when they have questions, even if they're not buying now. When they're ready to move forward—whether that's three months or three years from now—you want to be the person they think of.
