Objections aren't obstacles—they're invitations. When an investor raises a concern, they're telling you exactly what matters to them. They're revealing what needs to be true before they can move forward. This is valuable information.

The consultants who struggle with objections treat them as arguments to win. The consultants who excel treat them as opportunities to understand.

In this module, you'll master the LAER framework—Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond. It's a simple structure that works with any objection, whether it's about market timing, developer concerns, price, or hesitation to commit.

Your goal is never to overcome an objection. Your goal is to understand it completely, then provide the clarity the investor needs to make a confident decision.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to distinguish between genuine concerns and negotiation tactics, recognise buying signals hidden within objections, and maintain composure when facing challenging pushback.

Let's get started.
