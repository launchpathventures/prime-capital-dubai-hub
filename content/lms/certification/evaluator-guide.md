# Certification Assessment — Evaluator Guide
## Prime Capital Consultant Readiness Assessment

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Purpose

This guide helps founding team members conduct consistent, fair, and effective certification assessments. The goal is not to "test" candidates but to validate they're ready to represent Prime Capital to prospective clients.

---

## Philosophy

### This Is a Conversation, Not an Exam

The certification assessment is a practical demonstration of readiness. You're looking for someone who can:

- Handle real client situations with competence
- Represent the Prime Capital brand appropriately
- Navigate challenges without losing composure
- Show genuine care for client outcomes

### What We're NOT Doing

- Trick questions or gotcha moments
- Stress testing to breaking point
- Memorisation checks
- Box-ticking exercises

### What Success Looks Like

After a successful assessment, you should feel confident saying:

> "I would be comfortable introducing this person to one of my clients."

If you wouldn't say that, they're not ready — regardless of what scores suggest.

---

## Before the Session

### Review the Trainee's Profile

Open the LMS admin and check:

1. **Module completion** — Have they finished all competencies?
2. **Quiz scores** — Any areas where they scored below 80%?
3. **Time invested** — Did they rush through or take their time?

Make note of potential weak areas to watch during roleplay.

### Prepare Your Environment

- [ ] Quiet meeting room booked for 90 minutes
- [ ] Phone recording ready (or whatever recording method you use)
- [ ] This guide accessible (printed or tablet)
- [ ] Rubric ready for scoring
- [ ] Water available for both of you
- [ ] No interruptions scheduled

### Mental Preparation

Remember:

- They're nervous — your first job is to put them at ease
- Be fair in your roleplay — challenge, don't sabotage
- Stay in character, but don't be cruel
- Your goal is assessment, not proving they're not ready

---

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Welcome & Setup (5-7 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Reduce nervousness
- Set clear expectations
- Confirm consent to record

**Script (adapt to your style):**

> "Thanks for coming in. How are you feeling about today?"

[Let them respond — acknowledge any nerves as normal]

> "Before we start, let me explain what we're going to do. We'll work through five client scenarios together. I'll play the client, and you be yourself — a Prime Capital consultant."

> "There are no trick questions. I'm not trying to catch you out. I just want to see how you'd handle real conversations we have every week."

> "We'll record the session so we can review it later and give you proper feedback. Are you okay with that?"

[Get explicit consent]

> "Any questions before we start?"

[Answer any questions, then begin recording]

> "Okay, let's begin. First scenario..."

---

### Phase 2: Scenario Roleplay (50-60 minutes)

Work through all 5 scenarios in order. For each:

1. **Set the scene** (30 seconds)
   - Read the situation brief
   - Clarify any questions about context

2. **Run the roleplay** (10-12 minutes)
   - Become the client persona
   - Stay in character
   - Let them lead the conversation
   - Provide realistic responses

3. **Brief pause** (30 seconds)
   - Break character
   - Ask "How did that feel?"
   - Jot quick notes
   - Move to next scenario

**Important Roleplay Guidance:**

**DO:**
- Commit to the persona's concerns and style
- Give realistic buying signals when appropriate
- Create openings if they're struggling
- Let silences happen naturally

**DON'T:**
- Make it artificially difficult
- Withhold information unreasonably
- Be more difficult than a real client would be
- Break character to correct them

---

### Phase 3: Debrief & Discussion (10-15 minutes)

**Still recording.** This is valuable data.

> "Okay, that's our five scenarios. Before I share my thoughts — how do you feel it went?"

Let them self-assess. Listen for:
- Self-awareness about strengths and struggles
- Ability to reflect on their own performance
- Any concerns they want to raise

Share some initial impressions:
- What they did well (be specific with examples)
- Areas you noticed (frame constructively)

**Do NOT give the pass/fail decision in the room.**

> "I'm going to review my notes and the recording. I'll be in touch within 48 hours with the full feedback. Any questions?"

Stop recording after questions are answered.

---

### Phase 4: Post-Session Evaluation (15 minutes, alone)

Complete within 24 hours while memory is fresh.

1. **Score each rubric dimension** (1-5)
   - Review the dimension criteria
   - Use specific examples from the session
   - Trust your overall impression

2. **Calculate average score**
   - Add all five scores, divide by 5
   - Threshold: ≥3.5 to pass

3. **Check for red flags**
   - Any dimension below 2?
   - Any brand tone concerns?
   - Anything that made you uncomfortable?

4. **Make your decision**
   - Pass: Ready for client work
   - Needs Development: Specific areas to improve first

5. **Write qualitative notes**
   - What they did well (specific examples)
   - Areas for development (specific examples)
   - Recommendations for next steps

6. **Record in LMS admin**
   - Enter all scores
   - Add recording URL
   - Add notes
   - Mark status (passed/needs_work)

## Playing the Client Personas

Each scenario includes a detailed persona. Here's how to bring them to life:

### General Principles

**Commit to the character.** You're not you — you're Michael Torres, worried about his family's relocation. Stay in that mindset.

**Use their concerns.** Every persona has stated concerns and hidden concerns. Let these drive your responses.

**Match their communication style.** An analytical investor asks different questions than an emotional first-time buyer.

**Be realistic, not difficult.** A real Michael Torres wants to find a home. He's not trying to make the consultant fail.

### If They're Struggling

Stay in character, but create openings:

- Repeat a question differently
- Share more of the persona's concerns
- Give them an easier aspect to address
- Allow a natural pause for them to regroup

Remember: a good consultant can recognise when a client needs more guidance. Let them show that skill.

### If They're Doing Well

Don't artificially create problems. If they're handling it well:

- Let the scenario progress naturally
- Give appropriate buying signals
- Allow them to close or move forward
- Test depth by asking follow-up questions

---

## Decision Framework

### Clear Pass

- Average score ≥ 3.5
- No dimension below 3
- You feel confident they're ready
- No brand or tone concerns

> Communicate: Congratulations, schedule next steps, specific praise.

### Borderline Pass

- Average score 3.5-3.8
- One dimension at 2
- You feel "probably ready with supervision"
- Minor concerns but not dealbreakers

> Communicate: Pass with specific development areas, suggest light supervision initially.

### Needs Development

- Average score < 3.5, OR
- Any dimension below 2, OR
- Brand/tone concerns, OR
- Your gut says "not ready"

> Communicate: Not yet ready (not failure), specific areas to work on, clear path forward, timeline to retry.

---

## Communicating Outcomes

### Wait at Least 24 Hours

Don't deliver results immediately after the session. This:
- Gives you time to reflect properly
- Removes emotion from the decision
- Allows for complete documentation
- Sets a professional tone

### For a Pass

Call or meet in person. Be specific about what they did well:

> "Good news — you passed your certification. I was particularly impressed by [specific example]. Your handling of [scenario] showed real skill in [dimension]. A few areas to keep developing as you start client work: [specific feedback]. Welcome to the team."

### For Needs Development

Call or meet in person. Be honest but constructive:

> "I want to share some feedback from your assessment. There are a few areas where I'd like to see more development before you start client work. This isn't failure — it's about making sure you're set up for success."

Be specific:
- Which dimensions need work
- What specific behaviours to change
- Which modules/scenarios to revisit
- Timeline for attempting again (typically 1-2 weeks)

> "I know this isn't the news you hoped for, but I've seen people improve quickly with focused practice. Let's schedule a follow-up session for [date]."

---

## Recording & Documentation

### Recording the Session

- Use phone voice recording (simple, reliable)
- Confirm consent before starting
- Keep recording through debrief
- Save with clear naming: `certification_[name]_[date].m4a`

### Storing Recordings

- Upload to designated folder
- Add URL to LMS admin when recording outcome
- Retain for [X months] for quality purposes

### Transcription (Optional)

If transcription is useful for feedback:
- Use Otter.ai, Whisper, or similar
- Review for accuracy
- Save alongside recording

---

## Troubleshooting

### They Freeze During a Scenario

Give them space. Count to 5 silently. If still stuck:

> (As client) "Is everything okay? Take your time."

If needed, offer to restart that segment:

> (Breaking character) "Want to take a breath and try that again?"

### They Get Defensive

Stay in character and remain calm. A client who triggers defensiveness is realistic data. Note it for the rubric (Composure dimension).

### They Ask to Stop

Respect it immediately. Understand why:
- Medical/personal emergency → reschedule
- Overwhelming nerves → discuss options
- They want to quit → accept gracefully

### You're Unsure About the Decision

Sleep on it. Review the recording. Discuss with another founder if needed. The decision can wait 48 hours.
