**CONTEXT**

Exam-day performance comes down to two things: knowing the material and managing the clock. You've studied the content. Now let's make sure time pressure and test anxiety don't steal marks you've earned.

**THE PROCESS**

Start with the first five minutes. Don't rush into questions immediately. Read all instructions, note the total questions and time, and take a calming breath. Use your scratch paper to write down key numbers: ten point seven six, four percent, zero point two five percent, twelve months, ninety days, thirty days. Having them visible reduces cognitive load throughout the exam.

Now divide your time into three phases. The first pass gets forty minutes. Go through all questions, answering the ones you know confidently. When you hit a question that requires more thought, don't stop. Flag it and move on. Your goal in this phase is to bank easy marks and identify which questions need more time.

The second phase gets fifteen minutes. Return to flagged questions with fresh perspective. Often, answers become clearer when you're not under immediate pressure. Use elimination: cross out options you know are wrong to improve your odds. If you're down to two choices, trust your first instinct — research shows it's correct more often than second-guessing.

The final five minutes are for verification. Make sure every question has an answer — never leave blanks. Review any calculations you weren't fully confident about. Check that you didn't misread any "NOT" or "EXCEPT" questions.

For each question type, apply specific strategies. True-false questions with absolute words? Those statements are usually false. "All of the above" options? If two of the three preceding options are definitely correct, select "all." Calculation questions? Write the formula first, extract the numbers, calculate step by step, then verify your answer matches an option. "MOST appropriate" questions mean multiple options might be partially correct — look for the most complete answer.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, spending too long on difficult questions. Two minutes maximum, then flag and move. Second, changing answers without specific reason. Your initial instinct is usually right. Third, misreading inversion questions — words like "NOT" and "EXCEPT" flip what you're looking for. Fourth, leaving questions blank. An educated guess is always better than no answer.

**PRO TIP**

When you feel anxiety rising, use the four-four-four breathing technique. Breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, out for four seconds. It's physiologically calming and takes only twelve seconds. Then refocus on the single question in front of you — nothing else matters in that moment.

You've prepared for this. Trust your preparation, manage your time, and go pass that exam.
