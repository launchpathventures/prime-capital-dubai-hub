# Discovery: Investors

Investors approach Dubai real estate analytically. They're comparing you to every other agent they've spoken with, and Dubai to every other market they're considering. Your discovery must demonstrate expertise while uncovering the specific investment criteria that will guide your recommendations.

## The Investor Discovery Framework

### Opening the Conversation

Investors respect efficiency and expertise. Your opening should signal professionalism while creating space for honest dialogue.

**Opening Script**:
> "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Before I share any thoughts on opportunities, I'd like to understand your investment objectives and how Dubai fits into your broader strategy. This will help me provide relevant recommendations rather than generic options. Would that work for you?"

This opening establishes:
- You value their time
- You take a strategic, not transactional, approach
- Recommendations will be tailored, not mass-marketed

## Complete Investor Discovery Script

### Section 1: Opening Questions

Establish context for why they're looking at Dubai.

> "What's prompting your interest in Dubai real estate at this stage?"

**Follow-up variations based on response**:
- If they mention diversification: "What percentage of your portfolio is currently in real estate, and how much are you looking to allocate to Dubai?"
- If they mention yield: "What yields are you currently achieving in your home market, and what would make Dubai compelling?"
- If they mention referral: "What did they share about their experience that caught your attention?"

> "Have you invested in property outside your home market before? If so, where, and how has that experience been?"

This reveals sophistication level and potential concerns from prior experience.

---

### Section 2: Investment Objective Questions

Understand what they're trying to achieve.

> "When you think about this investment, what does success look like? Is it primarily capital appreciation, rental yield, or a combination?"

**Based on response**:

For **yield-focused** investors:
> "What gross yield would make this investment attractive compared to your alternatives?"

> "How important is net yield after all costs versus gross headline yield?"

> "Are you looking for rental income to supplement living expenses, or is this for reinvestment?"

For **capital growth** investors:
> "What appreciation expectations do you have, and over what timeframe?"

> "How do you typically measure appreciation—against inflation, against other asset classes, or absolute return?"

> "Are you comfortable with lower initial yield for higher growth potential?"

For **combination** investors:
> "If you had to prioritize one over the other—yield or growth—which matters more?"

> "What's the minimum yield you'd accept for a property with strong appreciation potential?"

---

### Section 3: Timeline Questions

Understand their investment horizon and urgency.

> "What investment horizon are you thinking about—is this a 3-5 year hold, or longer term?"

> "Do you have specific timing constraints on when you'd like to complete a purchase?"

> "Are there any external factors influencing your timeline—tax year, liquidity events, other transactions?"

**For off-plan consideration**:
> "Would you consider off-plan purchases with 2-3 year completion timelines, or do you need a property generating income immediately?"

> "If considering off-plan, are payment plans during construction attractive, or would you prefer to pay in full?"

---

### Section 4: Experience Questions

Gauge their sophistication and fill knowledge gaps.

> "How familiar are you with Dubai's property market? Have you visited recently?"

> "Do you have a sense of which areas interest you, or would you like guidance on that?"

> "Are you aware of the ownership structure in Dubai—freehold, off-plan registration (Oqood), and the regulatory framework?"

**Based on experience level**:

For **experienced** investors:
> "What's your view on the current cycle? Are you seeing this as an entry point, or are you concerned about valuation levels?"

For **first-time Dubai** investors:
> "Would it be helpful if I walked you through how Dubai compares to markets you're familiar with—regulatory structure, ownership rights, tax treatment?"

---

### Section 5: Portfolio Questions

Understand how Dubai fits their broader portfolio.

> "What's your current real estate allocation, and how does this potential Dubai investment fit in?"

> "Are you looking to complement existing holdings or diversify into a different property type?"

> "Do you have exposure to other international markets? How do you think about geographic diversification?"

> "Is this investment from liquid capital, or would it involve selling or leveraging other assets?"

**Currency considerations**:
> "What's your base currency? Are you attracted to or concerned about AED's USD peg?"

---

### Section 6: Budget Qualification

Get specific about investment parameters.

> "What investment amount are you considering for Dubai? Is this flexible based on the right opportunity?"

> "For context, quality yield-generating properties in established areas typically start around AED 1-1.5M, while premium locations are AED 2-3M+. Where do you see yourself in that range?"

> "Would you be paying cash, or would you consider UAE mortgage financing? The rates are currently around [current rates]."

**If they mention financing**:
> "Are you pre-approved or would you need to arrange financing? This affects timing and the properties we can consider."

**If they have flexibility**:
> "Would you consider splitting your budget across multiple smaller properties for diversification, or do you prefer concentrating in one asset?"

---

### Section 7: Financing Questions

If financing is relevant, go deeper.

> "What deposit amount are you comfortable with—20%, 25%, or higher?"

> "Are you comfortable with the current financing rates in UAE, or does the rate significantly impact your decision?"

> "Would you want the property to service the mortgage from rental income, or are you comfortable with cash flow support?"

> "Do you have an existing banking relationship in UAE, or would you need to establish one?"

---

### Section 8: Concerns & Risk Tolerance

Uncover objections before they become obstacles.

> "What concerns, if any, do you have about investing in Dubai real estate?"

**Common concerns to probe**:

> "How do you feel about the market cycle—are you concerned about buying at a peak?"

> "What's your comfort level with off-plan properties and construction risk?"

> "How important is liquidity—the ability to exit quickly if needed?"

> "Are there specific risks you'd want me to address before moving forward?"

> "Have you heard anything about Dubai real estate that gave you pause?"

---

### Section 9: Decision Framework

Understand how they make decisions.

> "When you've made investment decisions in the past, what factors have been most important?"

> "Are you the sole decision-maker, or will others be involved in this decision?"

> "What would need to happen for you to move forward with a purchase in the next [timeframe]?"

> "What would make you decide not to invest in Dubai?"

---

### Section 10: Closing Questions

Wrap up and confirm next steps.

> "Based on our conversation, is there anything else I should understand about what you're looking for?"

> "What's the best way to share opportunities with you—email, WhatsApp, calls?"

> "Would you like me to prepare a shortlist of options that match your criteria, along with yield projections?"

> "Are you planning to visit Dubai to view properties, or would you be comfortable making decisions remotely?"

## Coach Walkthrough: Investor Discovery Practice

### Scenario

**Client Background**: Michael, a Singapore-based entrepreneur in his 50s. Sold a business last year and is looking to deploy capital into real estate. Currently holds properties in Singapore and Sydney.

**Your Task**: Conduct comprehensive investor discovery.

### Sample Discovery Dialogue

**You**: "Michael, thank you for making time today. Before I share any thoughts on opportunities, I'd like to understand your investment objectives and how Dubai fits into your broader strategy. Would that work for you?"

**Michael**: "Yes, that makes sense. I've been hearing about Dubai yields from some contacts and want to understand if it's worth a look."

**You**: "What's prompting your interest at this stage? You mentioned hearing about yields—what specifically caught your attention?"

**Michael**: "Mainly the yield numbers. I'm getting 2-3% in Singapore, similar in Sydney. The 6-7% I'm hearing about Dubai sounds attractive, but I'm skeptical."

**You**: "That skepticism is healthy. You're right that headline yields in Dubai can reach 6-7%, sometimes higher in certain areas, but there's nuance. What gross yield would genuinely make this compelling for you, given your existing portfolio?"

**Michael**: "If I could reliably get 5%+ net, after all costs, that would be interesting."

**You**: "That's achievable in certain segments. When you think about this investment, is yield the primary objective, or are you also thinking about capital appreciation?"

**Michael**: "Yield is primary. I have growth exposure elsewhere. This would be income-generating."

**You**: "Understood. What investment horizon are you thinking about? Is this capital you're comfortable holding for 5+ years, or do you need more liquidity?"
