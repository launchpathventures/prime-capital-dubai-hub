MODULE 4.3: Off-Plan Evaluation
TYPE: skills
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Welcome to Off-Plan Evaluation — where you'll learn to assess pre-completion purchases systematically.

Off-plan properties are purchased based on plans, renders, and promises rather than a finished product. They can offer attractive entry prices and extended payment terms. They also carry risks that don't exist with ready properties.

In this module, you'll learn to evaluate the developer before anything else. Track record, delivery history, financial stability — these matter more than the glossy brochure.

You'll use a structured due diligence checklist covering developer profile, project specifics, quality indicators, and location assessment. Every box needs checking before you recommend an off-plan property.

You'll also learn to present off-plan opportunities honestly — framing the trade-offs, being transparent about unknowns, and sharing specific evidence about the developer.

The goal isn't to sell off-plan or avoid it. The goal is to match the right opportunity to the right investor with eyes wide open.

Let's get into the evaluation process.

### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

**CONTEXT**

You'll use this evaluation process every time a client considers an off-plan purchase. Getting it right protects your clients from bad investments and positions you as a thorough advisor. Getting it wrong — recommending a project that delays or disappoints — damages your reputation permanently.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through systematic off-plan evaluation.

Start with the developer — this is the most important factor. Before looking at the property itself, research the developer's track record. How many projects have they completed in Dubai? Were previous projects delivered on time? What do owners in completed buildings say about quality? Is the developer registered with RERA? What's their financial stability?

Red flags include: first project in Dubai with no track record, history of significant delays — eighteen months or more, quality complaints in completed projects, and any financial difficulties or ownership changes.

Next, use a structured checklist. For developer profile: confirm RERA registration on the DLD website, verify at least five years operating in Dubai, check for at least three delivered projects, assess average delivery delays — look for less than twelve months — and confirm no recent negative press or restructuring.

For project specifics: verify the escrow account is registered, check construction status — is ground broken or still awaiting approvals, assess completion timeline against current stage, review payment plan structure, and understand cancellation terms.

For quality indicators: visit a completed project by the same developer in a similar segment, review actual specifications not just marketing materials, check service charge estimates — they're often higher in new buildings — and verify what amenities are actually included versus masterplan vision.

For location assessment: understand infrastructure timeline — metro, roads, retail — when will they actually be delivered, research what comparable ready properties rent for, assess whether the area is established or emerging, and compare current accessibility versus future accessibility.

When presenting off-plan to investors, frame the trade-offs honestly. Don't say "This is a great opportunity — you'll make money when it completes." Do say "Off-plan offers a lower entry point and extended payments, but you're committing capital three years before you can rent the property. Let me share what I've found on this developer's track record."

Be honest about unknowns. Infrastructure often arrives twelve to eighteen months after residential handover. That affects initial rental demand. Say so.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, falling for marketing materials. Renders are not photographs. Visit completed projects by the same developer.

Second, ignoring delivery history. A developer with consistent delays will likely delay again.

Third, recommending off-plan to risk-averse investors. Some clients need ready properties. Don't push off-plan when it doesn't match their profile.

**PRO TIP**

When you recommend off-plan, present specific evidence: "I've evaluated this developer across four criteria. Track record: eight projects completed since twenty-fifteen, average delay six months — below industry average. Quality: I visited their Marina project from twenty-twenty-one, finish quality is good. Financial stability: publicly listed, consistent revenue. This project: construction at level twelve of thirty-five, escrow registered, targeting Q2 twenty-twenty-six." That's how you demonstrate due diligence.
