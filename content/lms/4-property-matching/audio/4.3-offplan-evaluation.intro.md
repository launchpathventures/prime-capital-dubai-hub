Welcome to Off-Plan Evaluation — where you'll learn to assess pre-completion purchases systematically.

Off-plan properties are purchased based on plans, renders, and promises rather than a finished product. They can offer attractive entry prices and extended payment terms. They also carry risks that don't exist with ready properties.

In this module, you'll learn to evaluate the developer before anything else. Track record, delivery history, financial stability — these matter more than the glossy brochure.

You'll use a structured due diligence checklist covering developer profile, project specifics, quality indicators, and location assessment. Every box needs checking before you recommend an off-plan property.

You'll also learn to present off-plan opportunities honestly — framing the trade-offs, being transparent about unknowns, and sharing specific evidence about the developer.

The goal isn't to sell off-plan or avoid it. The goal is to match the right opportunity to the right investor with eyes wide open.

Let's get into the evaluation process.
