**CONTEXT**

You'll use these calculations in almost every investor conversation. Whether you're evaluating a shortlisted property, comparing options, or answering questions about returns, yield is the language of investment property. Master this, and you speak the investor's language.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through each calculation.

Start with gross yield — the simplest measure. Take the annual rent, divide by purchase price, multiply by one hundred. For example: a Marina apartment purchased for two million dirhams, rented at ten thousand per month, that's one hundred twenty thousand annually. One hundred twenty thousand divided by two million equals six percent gross yield.

Gross yield is useful for quick comparisons between properties. Higher gross yield generally means better income relative to price. But here's the key point — gross yield doesn't account for costs. It's a starting point, not the final answer.

That's where net yield comes in. Net yield subtracts operating costs before calculating the percentage. Annual rent minus annual costs, divided by purchase price, times one hundred.

What are those costs? Service charges — typically twelve to twenty-five dirhams per square foot annually, higher for branded or luxury buildings. Property management — five to eight percent of rent if using a management company. Maintenance reserve — budget one to two percent of property value for repairs. Vacancy allowance — four to eight percent of annual rent, assuming two to four weeks vacant per year. And RERA fees — one sixty to two twenty dirhams annually.

Let me give you a real example. A Marina two-bedroom at two point five million dirhams, fourteen hundred square feet, renting at fourteen thousand monthly — that's one hundred sixty-eight thousand annually. Service charges at eighteen dirhams per foot equals twenty-five thousand two hundred. Property management at five percent is eight thousand four hundred. Maintenance reserve at one percent is twenty-five thousand. Vacancy at five percent is eight thousand four hundred. Total costs: sixty-seven thousand two hundred. Net operating income: one hundred thousand eight hundred. Net yield: four percent. Compare that to the gross yield of six point seven percent. That gap shows why costs matter.

Finally, total return — income plus capital appreciation. Take your net rental income, add annualised capital gain, divide by purchase price. This gives the full investment picture. In strong Dubai markets, capital appreciation has averaged eight to ten percent annually in premium areas. A property with four percent net yield and eight percent appreciation delivers twelve percent total return.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, quoting gross as if it's net. Misleading investors damages trust permanently.

Second, ignoring service charges, especially for branded residences where they can run twenty-five to thirty dirhams per square foot.

Third, assuming zero vacancy. Unrealistic. Always budget for turnover.

**PRO TIP**

When presenting yields, show your calculation, not just the answer. Sophisticated investors want to see the working. Say: "The gross yield is six point seven percent. After service charges, management, and vacancy allowance, the net yield is approximately four point two percent." Transparency builds trust.
