# EOI & Booking Process

## Introduction

The Expression of Interest (EOI) is where intent becomes commitment. This is often a high-pressure moment—popular units sell quickly, clients are making significant decisions, and smooth execution builds confidence or exposes incompetence.

This module teaches you to handle EOI and booking processes professionally, efficiently, and with the attention to detail that protects both client and transaction.

---

## Understanding EOI

### What EOI Represents

**Expression of Interest (EOI):**
- Formal indication of intent to purchase
- Temporary reservation of unit
- Commitment to proceed (typically with deposit)
- Starting point for SPA preparation

**EOI Is NOT:**
- A binding purchase contract (that's the SPA)
- A guarantee of purchase (terms may change)
- Permanent—units can be released if terms not met

### EOI vs. Booking

Some developers use different terminology:

| Term | Typical Meaning |
|------|-----------------|
| EOI | Soft hold, may be refundable |
| Reservation | Firmer commitment, partial deposit |
| Booking | Confirmed commitment with deposit |
| Token | Initial small payment to hold unit |

**Key Point:** Always clarify the exact terms with each developer—terminology varies.

## Pre-EOI Preparation

### Client Readiness Check

Before approaching EOI, verify client is ready:

**1. Financial Readiness**
- [ ] Budget confirmed and realistic
- [ ] Payment plan understood and affordable
- [ ] Deposit funds available (typically AED 50,000-200,000)
- [ ] Financing pre-approval (if using mortgage for handover)

**2. Decision Readiness**
- [ ] Property type confirmed (unit type, size, floor)
- [ ] Location validated (community, building, aspect)
- [ ] Investment thesis clear (own use, rental, capital growth)
- [ ] Timeline alignment (when do they need possession?)

**3. Documentation Readiness**
- [ ] Valid passport available
- [ ] Emirates ID (if resident)
- [ ] Power of Attorney (if signing remotely)
- [ ] Source of funds documentation (if required)

### Developer Information Gathering

**Before presenting units, confirm:**
- Current availability (units, floors, aspects)
- Pricing (published price list + any promotions)
- Payment plan options (may be multiple)
- EOI process specifics (amount, validity, refund policy)
- SPA timeline (when will it be ready?)
- Commission structure (what you'll earn)

---

## The EOI Process

### Step 1: Unit Selection

**Client Decision:**
- Review available units matching criteria
- Compare options (floor level, aspect, price)
- Make selection decision

**Your Role:**
- Present options clearly (not overwhelming)
- Highlight trade-offs (higher floor = better view, higher price)
- Confirm availability before final selection
- Guide but don't pressure

**Critical Action:**
> Before client decides, call/message developer sales team: "Confirming unit [number] is available for reservation."
>
> Get written confirmation if possible—units sell quickly.

### Step 2: EOI Form Completion

**Standard EOI Information:**

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Buyer name (as per passport) | Passport |
| Nationality | Passport |
| Passport number | Passport |
| Passport expiry | Passport |
| Emirates ID (if resident) | Emirates ID card |
| Contact number | Client |
| Email address | Client |
| Current address | Client |
| Unit number | Selection |
| Purchase price | Price list |
| Payment plan | Selection |
| Agent details | Your information |

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Name doesn't match passport exactly
- Wrong unit number
- Incorrect price or payment plan
- Missing signatures
- Incomplete contact information

### Step 3: Deposit Payment

**Typical EOI Deposits:**
- Range: AED 20,000 - 200,000 (varies by developer/project)
- Usually 5-10% of purchase price
- Sometimes fixed amount regardless of unit price

**Payment Methods:**
1. **Bank transfer** — Most common, requires correct account details
2. **Manager's cheque** — Made payable to developer (not agent)
3. **Credit card** — Some developers accept (may have fee)
4. **Cash** — Rarely accepted, avoid if possible

**Critical Verification:**
- Confirm exact account details for transfer
- Verify payee name for cheques
- Obtain payment receipt/confirmation
- Send proof of payment to developer

**Payment Safety Script:**
> "For the deposit, please transfer to [developer name] escrow account. I'll send you the exact bank details now via email. Once transferred, please forward the confirmation and I'll notify the developer immediately."

### Step 4: Documentation Submission

**Documents to Submit:**
1. Completed EOI form (signed)
2. Passport copy (clear, all pages if required)
3. Emirates ID copy (if resident)
4. Payment proof (transfer confirmation or cheque copy)
5. Agent details/Form A (if required by developer)

**Submission Method:**
- Email to developer sales team
- Developer portal/CRM upload
- In-person submission (some developers)

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] All documents legible and complete
- [ ] EOI form fully filled and signed
- [ ] Passport name matches EOI name exactly
- [ ] Payment proof attached
- [ ] Confirmation request sent to developer

### Step 5: Developer Confirmation

**After Submission:**
- Request acknowledgment from developer
- Confirm unit is reserved
- Obtain EOI receipt/reference number
- Clarify SPA timeline

**Follow-Up Timeline:**
- Immediate: Acknowledgment of submission
- Within 24-48 hours: Confirmation of reservation
- 7-14 days: SPA should be ready for signing

### If Unit Sells During Process

**Scenario:** Client is completing EOI, developer informs you unit just sold.

**Response:**

2. Apologize briefly: "I'm sorry, another buyer just completed their booking first."

## Common EOI Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Client Hesitates at Payment

**Situation:** Client gets cold feet when it's time to transfer deposit.

**Response:**
> "It's natural to feel nervous about this step—it's a significant commitment. Let me address any specific concerns you have. What's making you hesitate?"

**If concerns are valid:** Address them directly
**If cold feet without reason:** Gently reinforce decision
> "You've done thorough research and this unit meets all your criteria. The deposit is [refundable terms]. Shall we proceed?"

**If client truly not ready:** Don't push
> "I never want you to feel pressured. Let's take a day to think about it and reconnect tomorrow. I can't guarantee this unit will still be available, but I want you to be confident in your decision."

### Issue 2: Wrong Bank Details

**Situation:** Client transferred to wrong account.

**Response:**
1. Contact bank immediately for recall
2. Notify developer of situation
3. Request extension if needed
4. Document everything
5. Follow up until resolved

**Prevention:** Triple-check bank details before client transfers

### Issue 3: Passport Name Discrepancy

**Situation:** Client's passport name doesn't match exactly (e.g., middle name issues).

**Response:**
1. Use name exactly as it appears on passport
2. If multiple buyers, ensure all names correct
3. Clarify with developer if any concerns
4. Document the exact name spelling used

### Issue 4: Developer Doesn't Acknowledge

**Situation:** Developer hasn't confirmed EOI after 24+ hours.

**Response:**
1. Follow up via multiple channels (email, phone, WhatsApp)
2. Escalate to senior developer contact
3. Keep client informed of status
4. Document all follow-up attempts

## EOI Communication Scripts

### Initial Client Brief

> "Once you've selected your unit, we'll complete an Expression of Interest form and submit it with your deposit. The deposit is [amount] and is [refundable/non-refundable/conditional]. This reserves the unit while the developer prepares your Sales and Purchase Agreement—typically 7-14 days. Once the SPA is ready, we'll review it together and complete the signing. Do you have any questions about this process?"

### Post-EOI Confirmation

> "Great news—I've received confirmation from [developer] that unit [number] is reserved in your name. Your EOI reference number is [number]. The SPA should be ready by [date]. I'll follow up with the developer next week and keep you updated. In the meantime, please ensure you're ready for the SPA signing and down payment of [amount]."

### SPA Ready Notification

> "Your Sales and Purchase Agreement is ready. I've reviewed it and everything is in order. Can we schedule a time this week to go through it together and complete the signing? You'll need to bring [documents] and have [payment amount] ready for the down payment."
