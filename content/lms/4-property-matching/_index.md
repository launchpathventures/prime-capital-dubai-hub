# Property Matching

## Overview

Property matching is where expertise translates into value. An investor may know they want Dubai real estate — your job is to find the specific opportunity that fits their capital, timeline, and objectives.

This competency builds on client discovery. You've understood what the investor wants. Now you need to systematically evaluate options and present them in a way that builds confidence.

## Why This Matters

Poor property matching creates three problems:

1. **Wasted time** — Showing properties that don't fit the brief signals you weren't listening
2. **Lost trust** — Recommending unsuitable properties makes investors question your judgement
3. **Missed opportunities** — Failing to identify the right property means someone else closes the deal

Strong property matching creates lasting relationships. When you consistently find properties that align with investor goals, you become their trusted advisor — not just for this transaction, but for future portfolio decisions.

## What You'll Learn

This competency covers seven modules:

| Module | Focus | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 4.1 Property Analysis Framework | Systematic evaluation against requirements | 20 min |
| 4.2 Yield & ROI Calculations | Gross, net yields, and total return | 30 min |
| 4.3 Off-Plan Evaluation | Due diligence for pre-completion properties | 25 min |
| 4.4 Payment Plan Comparison | Explaining 60/40, 80/20, and other structures | 25 min |
| 4.5 Secondary Market Evaluation | Ready properties and resale assessment | 20 min |
| 4.6 Property Presentation | Building confidence without pressure | 30 min |
| 4.7 Comparative Market Analysis | Side-by-side property evaluation | 30 min |

## Behaviours We're Building

After completing this competency, you should be able to:

- **Systematically filter** a long list to a focused shortlist based on clear criteria
- **Calculate yields accurately** and explain what they mean in practical terms
- **Conduct due diligence** on developers and projects without overlooking key risks
- **Explain payment structures** in a way that helps investors make informed choices
- **Present properties** that demonstrate you've listened and understood the brief
- **Provide comparisons** that clarify trade-offs without overwhelming

## How This Connects

This competency works alongside:

- **Client Discovery** — You can't match properties without understanding requirements
- **Transaction Management** — The properties you recommend must be executable
- **Objection Navigation** — Many objections arise from poor property matching

## Assessment

Complete all seven modules and pass two knowledge checks:
- **Property Matching Quiz 1** (after module 4.2) — Yield calculations
- **Property Matching Quiz 2** (after module 4.4) — Payment plan structures

Passing score: 80%
