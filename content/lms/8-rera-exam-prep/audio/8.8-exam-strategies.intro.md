Knowing the content is only half the battle. Many candidates who understand the material well still struggle because they run out of time, misread questions, or fall for common traps.

You have forty questions in sixty minutes. That works out to ninety seconds per question. Not long. If you spend three minutes stuck on one question, you've stolen time from three others.

The exam uses specific question patterns: true-false statements with absolute words, "all of the above" options, calculation questions, and "MOST appropriate" scenarios. Each pattern has a strategy.

Absolute words like "always," "never," and "all" usually indicate false statements — regulations typically have exceptions. When you see "all of the above," check if you're certain two options are correct; if so, "all of the above" is likely the answer. For "NOT" and "EXCEPT" questions, you're looking for the wrong option, not the right one.

The seventy-five percent pass mark means you can get ten questions wrong and still pass. Don't let one difficult question derail your confidence. Flag it, move on, and return with fresh eyes.

In the walkthrough, I'll give you a tactical game plan for managing your time from the first minute to the last.
