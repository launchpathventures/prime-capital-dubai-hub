MODULE 8.1: RERA Exam Overview
TYPE: knowledge

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

The RERA broker exam is your gateway to legal practice in Dubai real estate. Without that broker card, you cannot facilitate transactions, earn commissions, or represent clients legally.

Here's what you're facing: forty multiple-choice questions, sixty minutes, and a seventy-five percent pass mark — that's thirty correct answers. Questions are scenario-based, testing how you'd apply regulations in real situations, not just whether you've memorized definitions.

The exam covers four main areas. Broker duties and ethics make up about a quarter of questions. RERA regulations and licensing — another quarter. Landlord-tenant law accounts for roughly twenty percent, as do transaction processes.

Here's what most candidates don't realize: the topics with the highest failure rates are specific numbers and timelines. Eviction notice periods. Fine amounts. Registration fees. The exam expects exact figures, not approximations.

Registration costs seven hundred seventy-two dirhams fifty fils. If you fail, wait fourteen days minimum before retaking. There's no limit on attempts, but each one costs the same fee.

Your advantage starts with knowing exactly what you're walking into.
