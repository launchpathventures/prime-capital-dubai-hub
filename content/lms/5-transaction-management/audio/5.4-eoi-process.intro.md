EOI is where deals are won or lost in minutes. Popular units sell fast. If you're fumbling with forms while another agent is submitting, your client loses the unit they wanted. Worse, if you make mistakes under pressure, you create problems that follow the transaction for years.

Here's what flawless EOI execution requires.

First, preparation prevents disasters. Before EOI day, confirm unit availability, verify payment plan options, obtain bank details, pre-fill what you can. Showing up unprepared to a high-pressure situation is amateur hour.

Second, accuracy matters more than speed—but you need both. Names must match passports exactly. One wrong letter creates title deed problems later. Wrong unit number, wrong price, incomplete forms—all delay the transaction and damage your credibility.

Third, payment verification is critical. Deposits to wrong accounts cause serious problems. Triple-check bank details before clients transfer. Obtain confirmation the moment payment goes through.

Fourth, have backup options ready. If the unit sells while your client is deciding, you need alternatives immediately. "Let me check what else is available" isn't good enough when someone just lost their first choice.

The key takeaway: EOI is your first real demonstration of transaction expertise. Flawless execution here—fast, accurate, calm under pressure—tells clients they made the right choice working with you. Fumbling tells them to worry about what else you might miss.
