The EOI — Expression of Interest — is the pivotal moment in the off-plan sales process. It's where interest becomes commitment.

An EOI is a reservation payment to hold a specific unit. Typically twenty to fifty thousand dirhams, it's usually refundable within a defined period. It's not the final commitment — that's the SPA, the Sales Purchase Agreement.

The EOI exists for good reasons. For the developer, it measures serious interest and filters time-wasters. For the buyer, it reserves their preferred unit and provides time for due diligence with minimal risk. For you, it converts interest to commitment and gives you a concrete next step.

This module teaches you how to introduce the EOI confidently, handle hesitation, and convert EOIs to formal bookings within forty-eight to seventy-two hours.

You'll learn the critical difference between creating appropriate urgency and applying pressure. Legitimate urgency is based on real facts — "this is one of three units left at this price point." Pressure tactics destroy trust.

The key mindset shift: the EOI protects the buyer's option while they decide. Frame it that way, and hesitation often melts away.
