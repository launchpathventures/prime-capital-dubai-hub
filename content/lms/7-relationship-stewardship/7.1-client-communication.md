# Client Communication Standards

Every message you send represents Prime Capital. This module establishes the communication standards that maintain our "antidote to the Dubai hustle" positioning.

## The Communication Principle

> **Quality over quantity. Relevance over frequency.**

Our clients are busy professionals. They don't want more messages — they want better ones. Every communication should pass a simple test: *Does this deserve their attention?*

## Response Time Standards

### The 24-Hour Rule

Acknowledge every client communication within 24 hours, even if you can't provide a complete answer yet.

**Example acknowledgment:**
> "Thank you for your message. I'm gathering the information you've requested and will have a full response for you by [specific day]. Please let me know if you need anything more urgently."

**Why this matters:** Fast acknowledgment shows you're attentive. Promising a specific timeline shows you're organised. Both build trust.

### When to Respond Immediately

Some messages warrant faster response:

- **Time-sensitive opportunities** — A property they expressed interest in has an update
- **Transaction milestones** — Completion dates, payment deadlines, document requirements
- **Direct questions with simple answers** — Don't make them wait for basic information
- **Expressions of concern** — If a client seems worried, address it promptly

### When Not to Rush

Conversely, don't sacrifice quality for speed:

- **Complex analysis requests** — Take the time to be thorough
- **Sensitive topics** — Think carefully before responding
- **After-hours messages** — Unless genuinely urgent, respond the next business day

## The Prime Capital Voice in Writing

### What Our Clients Expect

Our clients are sophisticated. They recognise quality in communication just as they recognise quality in property. They expect:

- **Clarity** — No jargon, no ambiguity
- **Brevity** — Get to the point
- **Substance** — Real information, not filler
- **Professionalism** — Proper grammar, careful formatting

### Email Structure

Use this structure for most client emails:

1. **Opening line** — Acknowledge context or previous conversation
2. **Core message** — The main information, clearly stated
3. **Next steps** — What happens now, who does what
4. **Closing** — Professional sign-off with availability

**Example:**

> Good afternoon [Name],
>
> Following our conversation about Emaar Beachfront, I've confirmed availability for Unit 1502 in the tower we discussed.
>
> Key details:
> - 3-bedroom, 2,100 sq ft
> - Price: AED 4.2M
> - Completion: Q4 2027
> - Payment plan: 60/40
>
> I've attached the floor plan and specification sheet. The developer is holding three units at this price point, so this availability window is likely 7-10 days.
>
> Would you like to schedule a call to discuss further? I'm available tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning.
>
> Best regards,
> [Your name]

### Language to Use

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Direct | "The completion date has been confirmed as March 2027." |
| Specific | "The price includes a 15% completion discount until February 28." |
| Confident | "I recommend reviewing the upper floors for better views." |
| Helpful | "I'll prepare a comparison of both options for your review." |

### Language to Avoid

| Avoid | Better Alternative |
|-------|-------------------|
| "I just wanted to check in..." | "Following up on our conversation about..." |
| "Hope this email finds you well" | Get straight to the purpose |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out" | "Let me know if you have questions" |
| "Best in class" / "World-leading" | Be specific about what makes it notable |
| Exclamation marks | Period. Professional tone. |

## Choosing Communication Channels

### Email

**Best for:**
- Detailed information that clients may need to reference later
- Attachments (documents, floor plans, contracts)
- Formal communications that need a paper trail
- Non-urgent updates

**Structure tip:** Use formatting (bullet points, headers) for longer emails. Make them scannable.

### Phone / Video Call

**Best for:**
- Complex discussions requiring back-and-forth
- Sensitive topics (pricing negotiations, concerns)
- Building rapport with new clients
- Urgent matters

**Protocol:** Always confirm the call with a brief agenda. Follow up with a summary email capturing key points and next steps.

### WhatsApp / Messaging

**Best for:**
- Quick, time-sensitive updates
- Confirming appointments
- Sharing quick photos or videos
- Clients who prefer this channel

**Caution:** WhatsApp can feel informal. Maintain professional tone. Don't send long messages — if it needs more than a paragraph, use email.

### In-Person Meetings

**Best for:**
- Property viewings
- Contract signing
- Relationship-building moments
- High-stakes discussions

**Protocol:** Always follow up with a written summary of what was discussed and agreed.

## Professional Boundaries

### Availability Expectations

Set clear expectations about your availability:

- **Standard business hours:** Clients can expect same-day response
- **Evenings and weekends:** You'll respond next business day unless urgent
- **Holiday periods:** Set out-of-office with alternative contact

Communicate these expectations early in the relationship. Most clients respect boundaries when they're clearly stated.

### Personal vs. Professional

Build rapport, but maintain appropriate distance:

- **Do:** Remember personal details (family, interests, upcoming travel)
- **Do:** Acknowledge significant events (congratulations on a new role)
- **Don't:** Over-share personal information
- **Don't:** Make the relationship feel transactional by only reaching out for business

### Handling Difficult Conversations

Sometimes you'll need to deliver unwelcome news — a delayed completion, a price increase, a document issue.

**Approach:**
1. **Be direct** — Don't bury bad news in paragraphs of preamble
2. **Be factual** — Stick to what you know, not speculation
3. **Be solution-oriented** — What can be done now?
4. **Be available** — Offer to discuss by phone if they prefer

**Example:**
> "I need to share an update on the completion timeline. [Developer] has notified us of a three-month delay to the Marina Gate project, with the revised completion now scheduled for September 2027.
>
> I know this isn't the news you were hoping for. I've reviewed the contract terms, and there are no financial implications for you from this delay. The developer has also offered [compensation/incentive] for affected buyers.
>
> I'm available to discuss this by phone whenever suits you. Would tomorrow morning work?"

## Common Mistakes

Watch for these communication pitfalls:

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|----------|
| "Just checking in..." | "Following up on our conversation about [specific topic]..." |
| Sending long, unformatted email paragraphs | Using bullet points and headers for clarity |
| "I hope this email finds you well" | Get straight to the purpose |
| Responding to every message within minutes | Setting appropriate response time based on urgency |
| Using exclamation marks for emphasis!!! | Professional tone with periods. |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out" | "Let me know if you have questions" |
| Sending WhatsApp messages after 9 PM | Respecting business hours unless truly urgent |
| Over-sharing personal details | Maintaining professional boundaries while building rapport |

## Putting It Into Practice

### Daily Habits

- Review your inbox at consistent times (morning, after lunch, end of day)
- Flag messages requiring more time, and schedule that time
- Before sending, re-read from the client's perspective

### Weekly Review

- Check for any clients you haven't been in touch with recently
- Review any outstanding follow-ups
- Update your CRM with recent interactions

### Quality Check

Before sending any client communication, ask:

- [ ] Does this deserve their attention?
- [ ] Is it clear what I'm communicating?
- [ ] Is there a specific next step or call to action?
- [ ] Does the tone match Prime Capital's voice?
- [ ] Have I proofread for errors?
