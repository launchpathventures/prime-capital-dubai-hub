**CONTEXT**

You'll use this framework every time you evaluate properties for a client. It's the difference between scattered recommendations and strategic advice. Get this right, and your clients will trust your judgement. Get it wrong, and they'll wonder if you're just showing them whatever's available.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through the three stages.

Stage one: hard filters. These are non-negotiable requirements — a property either passes or fails. Start with your full property list and apply each filter in sequence. Budget, location, property type, completion status, unit size. Any property that fails a single hard filter is removed. No exceptions.

Here's a critical point: if an investor says their budget is three million dirhams, don't show them a property at three point two million hoping they'll stretch. You're signalling that you don't respect boundaries. Apply filters honestly.

Stage two: soft preferences. These are the "nice to have" attributes. Sea view, high floor, branded residence, proximity to metro, developer reputation. Rate each property one to three on each preference. Three means fully meets, two is partial, one is doesn't meet. Then weight based on what the investor emphasised — a sea view might be essential for one investor and irrelevant for another.

Stage three: deal quality. After filtering and scoring, assess the deal itself. Is this priced fairly compared to similar properties? Are the payment terms competitive? Does the completion date align with their timeline? Will this be easy to rent or sell? What's the developer's delivery history?

Now, document everything. Keep a simple record showing why each property passed your hard filters, how it scored on preferences, and what makes the deal attractive. When you present, you should be able to explain every recommendation.

Finally, build your shortlist. Aim for three to five properties — more creates decision paralysis, fewer suggests you haven't done thorough work. Include the obvious fit that ticks all boxes, the value option that's slightly below target but better terms, and the stretch option that's slightly above criteria but exceptional quality.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, showing properties because "they're good deals" without connecting to investor requirements. Every recommendation needs a reason specific to this investor.

Second, ignoring hard filters for properties you personally like. If it fails a non-negotiable, it's out. Period.

Third, overwhelming clients with too many options. Decision paralysis kills deals. Curate, don't dump.

**PRO TIP**

When presenting your shortlist, frame each property's position: "I've selected three properties. The first is the closest fit to your brief. The second offers better value per square foot. The third is slightly above your target price but worth seeing because of the developer quality." This shows your thinking, not just your listings.
