Your pipeline is your business. Without discipline in managing it, you'll lose deals you should have won and waste time on deals that were never going to close.

Here's what happens without pipeline management: leads fall through cracks, follow-ups get missed, you can't predict your income, and you don't know where to focus your energy.

With proper pipeline management: every lead has a next action, follow-ups happen systematically, you can forecast with confidence, and you focus on the highest-value activities.

This module teaches you the seven-stage pipeline for off-plan sales: New Lead, Contacted, Qualified, Presenting, EOI Submitted, Booked, and Closed Lost. Each stage has clear entry criteria, exit criteria, and expected duration.

You'll learn the daily disciplines that separate professionals from amateurs: the ten-minute morning review, the follow-up block, and the five-minute end-of-day update. You'll learn to spot pipeline health problems — top-heavy, bottom-heavy, stalled deals, or drought — and how to fix them.

The mindset shift is simple but powerful. Amateurs work from memory. Professionals work from their pipeline.
