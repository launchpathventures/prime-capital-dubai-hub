Before you can ask the right questions, you need to understand who you're talking to. Every buyer approaching Dubai real estate falls into one of three primary personas—and getting this wrong means wasting time showing the wrong properties to the wrong people.

Here's what matters.

First, end-users. These are buyers who want to live in the property. Lifestyle, schools, commute, community feel—these drive their decisions. Numbers matter less than how the space feels.

Second, investors. Pure numbers people. They're comparing Dubai yields to London, Singapore, their home market. ROI, rental demand, exit strategy—that's their language.

Third, visa-seekers. For them, the property is a means to an end—UAE residency through Golden Visa. The AED two million threshold is their primary filter.

The key insight? Most clients are combinations. An investor who also wants visa eligibility. An end-user who cares about resale value. Your job is to identify the dominant motivation and adapt your approach accordingly.

Listen for signals. The questions clients ask reveal their true priorities. Someone asking about school catchments is an end-user, regardless of what they initially said about "investment."

Master persona recognition, and you'll stop wasting time on mismatched recommendations.
