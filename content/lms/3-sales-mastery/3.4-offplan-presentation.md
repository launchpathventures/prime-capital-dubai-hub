# Off-Plan Presentation Skills

## Module 3.4 — Skills + Script

Presenting off-plan properties requires a different approach than ready properties. You're selling a vision, a developer's track record, and a financial proposition — not just a physical space.

---

## The Challenge of Off-Plan

### What You're Up Against

**Buyers can't:**
- Walk through the actual unit
- See the finished views
- Experience the community
- Touch the materials

**So you must:**
- Paint a vivid picture
- Build confidence in the developer
- Make the numbers clear
- Address timeline concerns

---

## The Off-Plan Presentation Structure

### The BUILD Framework

**B - Background (Developer & Location)**
Establish credibility before introducing the property.

**U - Understanding Check**
Confirm the property matches their discovered needs.

**I - Investment Proposition**
Present the financial case clearly.

**L - Layout & Features**
Walk through the unit and development.

**D - Decision Pathway**
Explain next steps and timeline.

---

## Section B: Background (Developer & Location)

### Establishing Developer Credibility

**Script:**

> "Before I show you the specific units, let me give you some context on the developer.
>
> [Developer Name] has been in the Dubai market since [year]. They've delivered [number] projects, including [notable example]. Their handover track record is strong — their last three projects delivered on time, which is important in this market.
>
> This development, [Project Name], is in [location]. This area has seen [relevant growth/development]. Major landmarks include [X, Y, Z], and it's [X] minutes from [key destination]."

**Why this works:**
- Addresses the unspoken question: "Can I trust this developer?"
- Provides social proof through track record
- Anchors the property in a real place they can understand

### Location Presentation

**Key points to cover:**
- Distance to key destinations (airport, downtown, beaches)
- Planned infrastructure (metro lines, road expansions)
- Existing amenities (schools, healthcare, retail)
- Community development status

---

## Section U: Understanding Check

### Confirming Fit Before Deep Dive

**Script:**

> "Based on what you shared earlier — you're looking at primarily investment, budget around AED [X] million, and interested in [area/type]. This development fits that profile because [specific reason].
>
> Before I go deeper, does this general direction feel right to you?"

**Why this works:**
- Shows you listened
- Gets buy-in before investing presentation time
- Allows course correction if needed

---

## Section I: Investment Proposition

### Presenting the Financial Case

**Three components to cover:**

1. **Entry price and payment structure**
2. **Expected rental yield**
3. **Capital appreciation potential**

### Payment Plan Presentation Script

> "Let me walk you through the payment structure. This is a [X%] during construction, [Y%] on handover plan.
>
> For a unit priced at AED [total], here's how it breaks down:
>
> - **Booking fee:** AED [amount] (typically 5-10%)
> - **During construction:** [X%] spread over [Y] months
> - **On handover:** [Z%]
>
> So your total outlay during construction is AED [amount], with the balance due when you receive the keys.
>
> What this means practically: you're controlling a [total value] asset with [upfront amount] initially, and [monthly amount] during build."

**Payment Plan Visual:**

| Stage | Percentage | Amount (AED) | Timing |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Booking | 10% | XXX,XXX | On reservation |
| 1st Installment | 10% | XXX,XXX | 30 days |
| During construction | 30% | XXX,XXX | Monthly over 24 months |
| On handover | 50% | X,XXX,XXX | Completion |

### ROI Projection Script

> "In terms of returns, let's look at the numbers conservatively.
>
> **Rental yield:** Similar units in completed buildings nearby are achieving AED [rent] per year, which would represent around [X%] gross yield. After service charges and management, you're looking at [Y%] net.
>
> **Capital appreciation:** This area has seen [X%] price growth over the past [Y] years. Off-plan specifically has shown [relevant data]. I always recommend being conservative — budget for [realistic %] annual growth rather than peak figures.
>
> **Important context:** These are projections based on current market data. Real estate markets fluctuate, and past performance doesn't guarantee future results. But the fundamentals here are strong because [specific reasons]."

**Why honesty matters:**
- Sophisticated investors see through inflated projections
- Conservative numbers build trust
- You're positioning as an advisor, not a salesperson

## Section L: Layout & Features

### Walking Through the Unit

**Script structure:**

> "Now let me show you the specific unit. This is a [type], [X] bedrooms, [Y] sq ft.
>
> [Using floor plan or rendering]
>
> Here's the entry, leading into the main living space. As you can see, it's [describe layout benefit — open plan, good flow, etc.].
>
> The master bedroom is here, with [features]. The secondary bedroom(s) are here.
>
> Key features that stand out on this unit:
> - [Feature 1 and why it matters]
> - [Feature 2 and why it matters]
> - [Feature 3 and why it matters]
>
> For the development overall, you have access to [amenities — pool, gym, etc.]. The building includes [relevant features — parking, concierge, etc.]."

### Development Amenities

**Cover:**
- On-site facilities (pool, gym, spa)
- Retail and dining within development
- Parking allocation
- Concierge and management services
- Community features (parks, play areas)

---

## Section D: Decision Pathway

### Explaining Next Steps

**Script:**

> "So that's the overview of [Development Name]. If this feels like a good fit, here's how the process typically works:
>
> 1. **Next step:** We reserve the unit with an EOI (Expression of Interest) — typically AED [amount], fully refundable at this stage
> 2. **Due diligence:** You review the SPA (Sales Purchase Agreement), payment schedule, and development specs
> 3. **Formal booking:** Sign the SPA and pay the booking fee within [X] days
> 4. **Construction phase:** Regular payments according to the schedule, with updates from the developer
> 5. **Handover:** Final payment and receive your keys
>
> What questions do you have at this point?"

## Coach Walkthrough: Presentation Scenarios

<speak>Let me walk you through real Dubai presentations. I'll show you how to use the BUILD framework with actual developments, real payment plans, and honest ROI discussions. Watch the progression from credibility to commitment.</speak>

### Practice Scenario 1: New Launch Presentation

**Situation:** You're presenting a new Emaar development in Dubai Creek Harbour to a UK investor looking for rental yield.

<speak>Emaar is perfect for this because UK investors know the name. Creek Harbour is pre-Metro but that's coming. Here's the psychology: UK investors are sophisticated but often overestimate Dubai risks. Your job is developer credibility first, then location upside. Don't skip the background section.</speak>

**Realistic presentation example:**

> "Before I show you the specific units, let me give you context on Emaar. They've been the dominant Dubai developer since 2002 — they built Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, and Downtown Dubai. Their track record is 200+ projects delivered, including 5 on-time handovers in the past 18 months alone.
>
> Creek Harbour is their next master-planned community — 6 square kilometres on the waterfront. Dubai Creek Tower is the centrepiece (currently on hold, but infrastructure is progressing). Key advantage: you're 10 minutes from Downtown, but buying at 30% less per square foot.
>
> The Metro extension is scheduled for 2027. Based on what happened when JLT and Business Bay got Metro connections, we typically see 15-25% appreciation in the 12 months post-announcement of service start."

<speak>Notice what I did: Emaar track record with specific numbers, location positioned as value play not compromise, infrastructure upside quantified. No hyperbole, just facts that build confidence.</speak>

**Focus on:**
- Developer credibility (Emaar's track record)
- Location potential (Dubai Creek Tower, waterfront)
- Rental yield comparison with similar areas
- Payment plan advantages

### Practice Scenario 2: Payment Plan Walkthrough

**Situation:** An investor is confused about how payment plans work. They're used to UK mortgages where you pay one lump sum.

<speak>Payment plans confuse international investors. They think it's financing from the developer. It's not — it's a construction-linked payment structure. Use a real example with real numbers so they can see the cash flow benefit.</speak>

**Realistic payment plan example:**

> "Let me explain with a specific unit. We're looking at a 2-bedroom in Emaar Beachfront, total price AED 2.8 million.
>
> Here's the payment structure — this is a 60/40 plan:
>
> - **Booking:** AED 280,000 (10%) — due when you reserve
> - **During construction:** AED 1.4M (50%) — spread over 30 months, roughly AED 47K per month
> - **On handover:** AED 1.12M (40%) — due when you get keys in Q4 2027
>
> So your initial outlay is AED 280K, then AED 47K monthly for 2.5 years. Compare this to buying ready property where you need the full AED 2.8M upfront.
>
> Many investors take a mortgage for the handover payment. So you're securing a AED 2.8M asset with AED 1.68M in cash flow, mortgage the final AED 1.12M, and rent covers the mortgage from day one."

<speak>See how I made it concrete? Real development, real numbers, monthly breakdown that they can model in their head. Then I showed the leverage opportunity without making it sound risky. The psychology: they need to visualise their money timeline.</speak>

**Focus on:**
- Clear explanation of the construction-linked payment model
- Cash flow benefits during build
- Comparison with traditional purchase
- Post-handover financing options

### Practice Scenario 3: ROI Discussion

**Situation:** An investor is asking "What return can I expect?" and wants specifics.

<speak>This is where agents lose deals by either overselling or underselling. Oversell and sophisticated investors dismiss you. Undersell and you don't create urgency. The balance: realistic ranges with market evidence. Never promise specific returns.</speak>

**Realistic ROI discussion:**

> "Let me give you realistic projections for this 1-bedroom in Dubai Marina, priced at AED 1.6M.
>
> **Rental yield:** Current 1-beds in Marina are renting between AED 85-95K annually. Let's use AED 90K to be conservative. That's 5.6% gross yield. After service charges (roughly AED 12K) and management fees (5%), you're looking at about 4.8% net yield.
>
> **Capital appreciation:** Marina is a mature area, so I wouldn't project aggressive growth. Historical average is 3-5% annually, but that includes boom years. Conservative projection: 3-4% annual appreciation.
>
> **Combined return:** So you're looking at roughly 8-9% total annual return — 5% yield plus 3-4% appreciation. That's the realistic case.
>
> Important context: these are projections based on current market data. Real estate markets fluctuate. What makes this attractive is Dubai's fundamentals — population growth averaging 3% annually, 60,000+ new residences needed per year, and emirate-level policies supporting real estate investment."

<speak>Watch what I did: specific property, specific numbers, conservative assumptions stated explicitly, ranges not fixed numbers, and I anchored it in market fundamentals not speculation. This builds trust. A UK investor can verify these numbers independently, and when they match, you've earned credibility.</speak>

**Focus on:**
- Providing realistic ranges, not false precision
- Explaining the two components (yield + appreciation)
- Acknowledging market variables
- Building credibility through honesty
