## WARNING Issues (Non-Critical)

### ⚠️ Warning 1: Learning Objectives - Action Verb Usage

**Issue:** Some key takeaways use descriptive statements rather than action-oriented language.

**Examples:**
- Current: "Off-plan transactions have strict timelines"
- Suggested: "Manage off-plan timelines to prevent deal failures"

**Impact:** Minor - Does not affect content accuracy or usability. This is a stylistic enhancement that could improve pedagogical value.

**Recommendation:** Consider rewording key takeaways in a future revision to use stronger action verbs (e.g., "Verify," "Manage," "Execute," "Document" rather than "has," "is," "are").

**Priority:** LOW - Content is production-ready as-is
