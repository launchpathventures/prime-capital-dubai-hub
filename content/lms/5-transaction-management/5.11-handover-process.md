# Handover Process

## Introduction

Handover is the moment when your client receives the keys to their property. For off-plan purchases, this is the culmination of years of waiting. For secondary purchases, it's the final step after transfer. Either way, getting handover right—thorough inspection, proper documentation, smooth key collection—protects your client's interests.

This module covers the handover process, with particular focus on snagging inspection for off-plan properties.

## Off-Plan Handover

| Balance of purchase price | Per payment plan |
| DLD fees (if not prepaid) | 4% of purchase price |
| Service charge (1 year advance) | Varies by community |

| Admin fees | Varies by developer |

## Snagging Inspection

### What is Snagging?

**Snagging** is the process of identifying defects, incomplete work, or items not meeting specification in a newly constructed property before accepting handover.

### Why Snagging Matters

**For Client:**
- Identifies issues while developer is still responsible
- Documents defects for warranty claims
- Protects against inheriting unacceptable quality
- Ensures property matches specifications

**Your Role:**
- Conduct thorough inspection
- Document all issues found
- Negotiate resolution with developer
- Advise client on acceptance decision

### Snagging Timing

**Options:**
1. **Before final payment:** Maximum leverage, but some developers don't allow
2. **Before key collection:** Standard timing, issues documented before acceptance
3. **After key collection:** Less leverage, but within warranty period

**Best Practice:** Conduct initial snagging before accepting handover; document issues and agree remediation timeline.

## Documenting Defects

### How to Document

**For Each Issue:**
1. **Location:** Specific room and position
2. **Description:** What the defect is
3. **Photo:** Clear image showing issue
4. **Reference:** Specification not met (if applicable)

**Example Entry:**
> **Location:** Master bedroom, north wall, 1.5m from door
> **Issue:** Crack in paint approximately 15cm long
> **Photo:** Unit301_MasterBR_NorthWall_PaintCrack_001.jpg
> **Spec Reference:** Walls should be crack-free (spec section 4.2)

**Photo Naming Convention:**
Use descriptive names: `[Unit]_[Room]_[Location]_[Issue]_[Number].jpg`
This makes it easy to organize and reference photos across multiple properties and inspections.

- Developer name

**Summary:**

## Resolving Snagging Issues

### Process

1. **Present snagging list** to developer representative
2. **Agree on validity** of each item
3. **Agree timeline** for remediation
4. **Document agreement** in writing
5. **Schedule re-inspection** if needed

### Negotiation Tips

**Minor Issues (paint touch-ups, cleaning):**
- Developer typically fixes within 1-2 weeks
- May fix before key collection
- Standard to accept keys with minor issues pending

**Significant Issues (plumbing, electrical, fixtures):**
- Push for resolution before accepting
- If accepting, document clearly with commitment
- Consider withholding final payment portion

**Major Issues (structural, specification changes):**
- Do not accept without resolution
- Escalate to developer management
- May require legal advice

### If Developer Disputes

**Steps:**
1. Refer to specification sheet (attached to SPA)
2. Provide photos and documentation
3. Escalate to developer management
4. File RERA complaint if necessary
5. Seek legal advice for significant disputes
