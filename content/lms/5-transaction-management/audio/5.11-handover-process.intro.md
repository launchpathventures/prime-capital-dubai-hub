MODULE 5.11: Handover Process
TYPE: skills

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Handover is your last chance to protect your client before they take ownership. For off-plan properties, this is when you discover whether the developer delivered what they promised. Accept sloppy work without documentation, and your client lives with problems. Catch issues now, and the developer fixes them.

Here's what thorough handover requires.

First, snagging isn't optional—it's essential. Inspect every surface, every fixture, every system. Paint cracks, loose tiles, malfunctioning AC, plumbing leaks—document everything with photos and written descriptions before accepting keys.

Second, specifications are your reference. The developer promised specific finishes, appliances, and quality levels in the SPA. Compare what's delivered against what was specified. Different brand, lower quality, missing item—all legitimate snagging points.

Third, negotiate resolution before accepting. Minor issues with committed fix timelines are normal. Significant issues—plumbing problems, electrical faults, major specification changes—require resolution first. Your leverage disappears once keys are accepted.

Fourth, utilities and access aren't automatic. Guide clients through DEWA registration, internet setup, building access arrangements. These practical details matter to their experience of taking ownership.

The key takeaway: Handover is when you prove you're an advocate, not just a transaction processor. Thorough inspection, documented issues, negotiated resolution—this is your final service before the client becomes an owner. Do it well, and they'll remember you as someone who protected their interests to the very end.
