## Output Required

For each module below, generate:
1. **INTRO SCRIPT** (60-90 sec / ~150-200 words): Why this matters, 3-4 essentials, key takeaway
2. Additional script based on type:
   - knowledge modules: Intro only
   - skills-script modules: DEMO (3-5 min / ~600-700 words) with weak/strong examples

## Output Format

```
===
MODULE 1.X: [Title]
TYPE: [knowledge/skills-script]

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)
[Script text]

### DEMO (if skills-script type, 3-5 minutes)
[Script with: Setup → Weak example → Coach analysis → Strong example → Coach analysis → Key difference]
```

---

## Demo Script Structure

For skills-script modules, use this structure:
1. **SETUP** (15 sec): "Let me show you two versions of [scenario]..."
2. **WEAK DEMO** (45-60 sec): Bad example with dialogue
3. **COACH ANALYSIS** (30-45 sec): 3-4 specific problems
4. **STRONG DEMO** (60-90 sec): Good example with dialogue
5. **COACH ANALYSIS** (30-45 sec): What made it work
6. **KEY DIFFERENCE** (15 sec): The single biggest change

Dialogue formatting:
- Use "The phone rings." not "*[Phone rings]*"
- Use "The agent says:" and "The client responds:" to mark speakers
- No asterisks, brackets, or markdown formatting
