# First Contact Excellence

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **respond to a new lead within 60 seconds** using a script that opens dialogue, establishes credibility, and secures a next step—all without sounding like a salesperson.

---

## Why Response Time Changes Everything

When someone enquires about a property, they're interested *right now*. Five minutes later, they've messaged three other agents. Ten minutes later, they're back to browsing. An hour later, they can't remember which agent seemed competent.

**The data:**

| Response Time | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| Under 5 minutes | 21x more likely to qualify |
| 5-30 minutes | Competitive disadvantage begins |
| Over 1 hour | They've spoken to 2-3 competitors |
| Next day | Essentially cold outreach |

The 60-second window isn't about being pushy—it's about being helpful when they actually want help.

## The Prime Capital First Contact Script

This is your primary script. Master this before learning variations.

**Scenario:** A lead enquired about an off-plan project through Property Finder.

### The Script (Annotated)

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. You just enquired about [Project Name]—I'm actually working with several clients on that development right now."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've confirmed you're responding to their enquiry (not cold calling), and you've established credibility without bragging. "Working with several clients" positions you as active and knowledgeable.*

<speak>
**You:** "Is now a good time for a quick two-minute conversation?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You're respecting their time and asking permission. Most agents launch into a pitch. You're already different.*

**If they say yes:**

<speak>
**You:** "Perfect. Before I share any details, I'd like to understand what you're looking for. Are you considering this for investment, or would you be living there yourself?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've pivoted to understanding them immediately. You're an advisor seeking to help, not a salesperson seeking to sell.*

**If they're busy:**

<speak>
**You:** "No problem at all. When would work better for you—tomorrow morning or afternoon? I'll send you my direct WhatsApp with some information about the development in the meantime."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've proposed a specific alternative (not "I'll call back sometime") and you've created a reason to follow up via another channel.*

### What Makes This "Quiet Luxury"

Notice what the script **doesn't** do:

- No pressure ("This is selling fast! Limited units!")
- No pitch (price, features, amenities)
- No assumptions about what they want
- No desperation ("I'd love to help you!")
- No generic ("How can I help you today?")

The tone is confident, unhurried, professional. You're the advisor they're fortunate to have reached.

## 🎧 Coach Walkthrough

*Listen to this section to hear the script in action with coaching commentary.*

<speak>
**Coach:** Let's walk through a real first contact call. I'll play both sides so you can hear how this sounds in practice.

The lead—Ahmed—just enquired about DAMAC Lagoons through Property Finder. He submitted the form 4 minutes ago. Here's how you open:

**Consultant:** "Hi Ahmed, this is Sarah from Prime Capital. You just enquired about DAMAC Lagoons—I'm actually working with several clients on that development right now. Is now a good time for a quick two-minute conversation?"

**Coach:** Notice what just happened. I confirmed I'm responding to HIS enquiry—not cold calling. I mentioned I'm working with other clients on the same project, which builds credibility without bragging. And I asked permission before diving in.

**Ahmed:** "Yeah, I have a few minutes."

**Coach:** He said yes. Now watch—I don't launch into a pitch about the project. I pivot immediately to understanding HIM:

**Consultant:** "Perfect. Before I share any details, I'd like to understand what you're looking for. Are you considering this for investment, or would you be living there yourself?"

**Coach:** See that? No "let me tell you about the amazing amenities." I went straight to his needs. That's the Prime Capital difference.

**Ahmed:** "Investment. I'm looking at rental yield mainly."

**Coach:** Now I have direction. I can ask about budget, timeline, and experience. But notice—I'm still asking, not pitching:

**Consultant:** "Got it. And have you invested in Dubai property before, or would this be your first purchase here?"

**Coach:** This question tells me how much education he needs and how to frame the conversation. A first-timer needs different support than an experienced investor.

**Ahmed:** "I bought an apartment in JVC two years ago. This would be my second."

**Consultant:** "Excellent—so you're familiar with the process. What's driving the interest in DAMAC Lagoons specifically? Is it the location, the developer, or something else?"

**Coach:** Now I'm understanding his motivation. His answer will tell me whether he's comparing multiple options or has already done research. Either way, I'm positioning myself as someone who wants to understand before recommending.

The key throughout: stay curious, stay calm, and let HIM guide where we go. That's quiet luxury in action.

## Practice Checkpoint

Before continuing, practice the opening out loud three times. Then try this:

**Quick Practice:** A lead named Maria just enquired about Emaar Beachfront 2 minutes ago. Call her.

Record yourself. Did you:

- [ ] State your name and company clearly?
- [ ] Reference her specific enquiry?
- [ ] Mention you're active on this project?
- [ ] Ask if it's a good time?
- [ ] Open with a question about her needs, not a pitch?

If you checked all five, continue. If not, practice again.

## Variations by Lead Source

These are reference scripts for different situations. Return here when you encounter these lead types.

<details>
<summary><strong>Developer Launch Lead</strong></summary>

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I noticed you registered interest in [Project Name]. I've been working closely with [Developer] on this launch and have access to the full unit inventory. Is now a good time to talk about what you're looking for?"
</speak>

**Key difference:** Emphasize your developer access—they're likely getting calls from many agents. Position your access as valuable.

**If they say yes:**

<speak>
**You:** "Great. There's been a lot of interest in this launch—before I walk you through the options, I'd like to understand your priorities. Are you focused primarily on investment returns, or are you considering this for personal use as well?"
</speak>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Referral Lead</strong></summary>

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. [Referrer Name] mentioned you might be looking at property in Dubai—I've been working with them on their investments and they thought we might be a good fit. Is now a good time?"
</speak>

**Key difference:** Lead with the relationship. Trust is already partially established. Acknowledge the referrer before anything else.

**If they say yes:**

<speak>
**You:** "Thank you for taking the time. [Referrer] mentioned you might be interested in [whatever context was shared]. Before I share any thoughts, I'd love to hear more about what you're looking for."
</speak>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Website Direct Enquiry</strong></summary>

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. Thank you for reaching out through our website. I'd love to help with your Dubai property search. Is now a good time for a brief conversation?"
</speak>

**Key difference:** They found Prime Capital specifically—acknowledge that. They've already shown interest in our approach.

**If they say yes:**

<speak>
**You:** "I appreciate it. To make sure I'm helpful, could you share what prompted you to start looking? Are you considering Dubai for investment, lifestyle, or perhaps residency through the Golden Visa?"
</speak>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Social Media Lead</strong></summary>

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out! Happy to help with your questions about Dubai property. What's prompting your interest?"
</speak>

**Key difference:** More conversational tone. They may be early in their journey. Match their energy—if they messaged casually, respond casually.

This may be via WhatsApp or Instagram DM rather than phone call. Read the medium.

## Handling "I'm Busy Right Now"

This will happen often. Here's how to handle it gracefully:

<speak>
**Client:** "Actually, I'm in a meeting. Can you call back?"

**You:** "Of course. Would tomorrow morning or afternoon work better for you? I'll send you a quick WhatsApp with my details and some information on the project so you have it when you're ready."

**Client:** "Tomorrow afternoon is fine."

**You:** "Perfect—I'll call around 3pm. And just so you know, I'm here if any questions come up before then. Talk soon."
</speak>

**Why this works:**
- You've locked in a specific time
- You've created a reason to follow up on WhatsApp
- You've positioned yourself as available without being needy
- You ended with confidence, not desperation

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Starting with a pitch**

❌ "Hi, I'm calling about DAMAC Lagoons—we have amazing 3-bedroom villas starting from 1.5 million..."

✅ Open with who you are, why you're calling, and a question.

**2. Sounding scripted or robotic**

❌ Reading word-for-word without natural flow

✅ Know the structure, but adapt your tone to the person. If they're relaxed, be relaxed.

**3. Ending without a next step**

❌ "Great, well let me know if you have questions. My number is..."

✅ Always propose something specific: a time to talk, information to send, or a meeting to schedule.

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Before you call:**
- Lead name (pronunciation if unusual)
- Property/project they enquired about
- Lead source (shapes your approach)
- Quiet environment, full attention

**The call structure:**
1. Greeting + context (10 sec)
2. Permission check (5 sec)
3. Opening question (10 sec)
4. Listen and qualify (varies)
5. Propose next step (10 sec)

**If busy:**
- Specific alternative time
- WhatsApp follow-up
- Leave them feeling valued, not interrupted

---

## Key Takeaways

- Respond within 5 minutes—speed is your competitive advantage, but quality beats speed alone
- Open with questions, not pitches—you're an advisor, not a telemarketer
- Always secure a specific next step—vague endings lose opportunities
- The script is a framework—adapt your tone to match the person
- "Quiet luxury" means confident, unhurried, and focused on them—not desperate or pushy

## AI Practice: Portal Lead Response

**You are calling:** Sarah Mitchell, 38, British expat currently living in Singapore. Works in finance, considering relocating to Dubai for work.

**Her situation (reveal gradually):**
- Budget: AED 1.5-2 million
- Goal: Apartment to live in initially, investment potential secondary
- Timeline: 4 weeks to decide, job starts in 3 months
- Concerns: Doesn't know Dubai areas, worried about choosing without seeing in person
- She's contacted 4 agencies—you're one of them

**Her communication style:**
- Professional and direct
- Skeptical of sales tactics
- Appreciates efficiency and expertise
- Responds well to good questions
- Put off by pressure, small talk, or generic pitches

**Her enquiry:** 2BR apartment in Business Bay, AED 1.8M, sent 5 minutes ago via Property Finder.

**Your objectives:**
1. Open appropriately using the Prime Capital approach
2. Qualify her situation (timeline, experience, priorities)
3. Address her concern about buying remotely
4. Secure a next step (not a vague "I'll send you some listings")

**Feedback criteria:**
- Quality of opening (confident, clear, permission-seeking)
- Qualification questions asked (meaningful, not interrogation)
- How remote purchase concerns were handled
- Whether a specific next step was secured
- Overall tone: advisory vs salesy
- Rating: Needs Work / Competent / Strong
