Closing isn't manipulation — it's helping someone who's ready to buy actually make the decision.

Here's the truth: if someone doesn't want your property, no technique will change that. But if someone does want it and is hesitating due to uncertainty, fear, or indecision — that's where closing skills matter.

At Prime Capital, we don't use high-pressure tactics, manipulation, false urgency, or guilt. We do use clear communication, confidence in our recommendations, help with decision-making, and respect for their timeline.

This module teaches you to recognise buying signals — both verbal and non-verbal — and select the right closing technique for each situation. You'll learn five approaches: the assumptive close, the summary close, the alternative close, the urgency close when appropriate, and the trial close.

You'll also learn to handle last-minute objections. "I need to think about it." "The price is higher than I expected." "I'm worried about the developer." Each has a specific response framework.

The philosophy is simple: closing is removing barriers for someone who wants to buy. Your job is to guide them to the decision they already want to make.
