## Project Stress Test — Team-Handover
_Use this whenever you need to stress-test and align with AI (pre-handover)._

@AI: We're preparing an internal handover of key documents to the team for initial delivery. To support this, I want you to run a **full project stress test** with me.

This is a **Catalyst project**. Catalyst uses a structured delivery loop (Brief → Build → Review → Refine) and staged progression (POC → MVP → MMP → PROD). The stress test ensures we're genuinely aligned before advancing.

Your role in this step is to slow down slightly, challenge assumptions, and ensure we are genuinely aligned on direction, scope, and success — not just moving forward out of momentum.

This step may involve back-and-forth clarification. That is expected.

## Step 1: Restate Your Understanding

Start by clearly restating, in your own words:

- What you believe the **core purpose** of this project is
- What problem or opportunity it is *really* trying to address
- Who this is primarily for
- What success looks like at the end of the first POC / phase

Be concise but concrete.

## Step 2: Identify Gaps, Risks & Assumptions

Critically assess your current understanding and list:

### a) Assumptions
- Things you are currently assuming to be true
- Areas where intent has been implied but not confirmed

### b) Ambiguities
- Any parts of the project that are still unclear, underspecified, or open to interpretation
- Areas where multiple reasonable directions could exist

### c) Risks
- Delivery risks (scope, complexity, sequencing)
- Alignment risks (stakeholders, expectations, definition of success)
- Conceptual risks (are we solving the right problem?)

Do not soften this section. The goal is risk reduction, not reassurance.

## Step 3: Challenge Where Necessary

Where appropriate:
- Challenge the current direction if it feels unfocused, overloaded, or misaligned with the stated goals
- Call out potential scope creep or “nice-to-have” drift
- Highlight trade-offs we may not have explicitly acknowledged

Frame challenges constructively, but clearly.

## Step 4: Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask **only the questions that materially affect direction or success**.
Avoid questions that can be safely deferred.

Questions should help resolve:
- what we are optimising for,
- what we are deliberately not doing,
- and what must be true for this phase to be considered a success.

## Step 5: Declare Readiness

Once sufficient clarity is reached, explicitly state one of the following:

- **“I am ready to produce the handover documents.”**
or
- **“I need the following clarifications before I can responsibly produce the handover documents.”**

Do not proceed to document creation until readiness is clearly established.

## Guiding Principle

This step exists to prevent us from confidently building the wrong thing.

Optimise for:
- clarity over speed,
- alignment over assumption,
- and momentum that is earned, not forced.

Begin with Step 1.
