Let me show you expectation management in a challenging scenario. The client is a successful Saudi businessman expecting ten percent yields and 2019 prices in a 2024 market. Watch how to reset expectations while maintaining the relationship.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

Agent: "Ahmed, good to connect. So you're interested in Marina. Great choice! What's your budget?"

Ahmed: "Around three million. My research shows I should get ten percent rental yields at that price point."

Agent: "Well, ten percent might be a bit high for Marina specifically. But yields are definitely good. Let me show you some options."

Ahmed: "I've also heard prices are lower than they were a few years ago. I want to buy at pre-pandemic levels."

Agent: "The market has moved a bit, but there are still good deals. I can find you something competitive."

Ahmed: "So can you get me something at three million with ten percent yield?"

Agent: "Let me see what's available. I'll send some options over."

**COACH ANALYSIS**

The agent dodged the expectation problem entirely. Multiple failures.

First, yield expectation wasn't addressed directly. "Might be a bit high" is weak. Ten percent net in Marina doesn't exist. The agent should have said so clearly.

Second, price expectation was glossed over. "The market has moved a bit" doesn't convey that Marina prices are significantly higher than 2019. Ahmed still thinks he can buy at old prices.

Third, the agent promised to "find something" that doesn't exist. Now they'll either disappoint Ahmed with reality later, or waste time searching for unicorns.

Ahmed leaves this conversation with his unrealistic expectations intact. The eventual collision with reality will be worse.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

Agent: "Ahmed, I appreciate you sharing your research. Let me give you the complete picture on yields, because there's nuance that marketing materials don't capture."

Ahmed: "I've seen properties advertising nine to ten percent."

Agent: "Those numbers exist in specific scenarios. First, they're often in developing areas with higher risk—newer communities, less established infrastructure. Second, they're gross yields before costs. Third, some developers subsidize 'guaranteed returns' by inflating purchase prices—you're essentially paying for your own yield upfront."

Ahmed: "So what's realistic in Marina?"

Agent: "Marina gross yields are five to seven percent currently. Net yields after service charges, maintenance, vacancy, and management are four to five and a half percent. That's still excellent by global standards—London is three percent, Singapore is two to three percent—but it's not the ten percent you were expecting."

Ahmed: "That's quite different from what I read."

Agent: "It is, and I want you to make decisions based on reality. Here's the trade-off: you can chase higher headline yields in emerging areas with higher risk, or you can accept sustainable yields in established communities with lower risk. What matters more to you—the yield number or the reliability?"

Ahmed: "Reliability matters. What about prices? I thought the market was down from a few years ago."

Agent: "That was true from 2014 to 2020—significant correction. But since 2020, Dubai has been in a strong growth phase. Marina prices today are higher than 2019, not lower. Let me show you the DLD transaction data."

Ahmed: "So I can't buy at 2019 prices."

Agent: "Unfortunately, no. The market you're looking for doesn't exist anymore. Current Marina prices are around [X] per square foot for quality buildings. In 2019, that might have been [Y]. We can discuss whether this is still attractive at current valuations, but I can't pretend 2019 pricing is available."

Ahmed: "I appreciate the honesty. Most agents just tell me what I want to hear."

Agent: "That doesn't serve you well. Let me show you what your budget actually achieves in today's market, with realistic yield projections. Then you can decide if Dubai still makes sense compared to your alternatives."

Ahmed: "Yes, show me that."

Agent: "Perfect. One more expectation to set: Dubai has had strong recent performance, and long-term fundamentals are solid. But this market has corrected significantly before—2008, 2014. I'd encourage thinking about this as a five to ten year investment, not a quick flip. Does that align with your thinking?"

Ahmed: "I'm looking at long-term holds anyway. That works."

Agent: "Good. Let me prepare a realistic analysis for you—current pricing, achievable yields, and what your three million actually buys in different areas. We'll go from there."

**COACH ANALYSIS**

What made this work?

First, yield expectations were addressed with evidence. Specific numbers, comparison to global markets, explanation of why headline numbers mislead.

Second, price reality was delivered directly. "The market you're looking for doesn't exist anymore"—clear, honest, and backed by DLD data reference.

Third, client was educated on risk trade-offs. Higher yield versus established community—now Ahmed can make an informed choice.

Fourth, market risk was contextualized. Historical corrections mentioned, long-term horizon recommended.

Fifth, the relationship strengthened through honesty. Ahmed's response—"most agents just tell me what I want to hear"—shows trust building.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version avoided the difficult conversation. The strong version had it directly and early.

Expectation management isn't about being negative—it's about building a foundation of trust through honesty. Clients who start with realistic expectations have positive experiences. Positive experiences generate referrals. That's how you build a sustainable career.
