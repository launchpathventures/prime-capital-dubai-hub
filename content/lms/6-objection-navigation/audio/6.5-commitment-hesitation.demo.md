**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of handling a stall objection. An investor has said "I need to think about it" after every conversation for two months. They've just said again: "Let me think about it some more. I'll let you know."

**WEAK DEMO**

*Consultant sounds tired but accommodating:*

"Sure, no problem. Take all the time you need.

Is there anything else I can send you? More market data? Another property comparison?

I'll follow up next week to see where you're at. In the meantime, if you have any questions, just reach out.

I really think this could be a great investment for you. The market is moving, so I'd hate to see you miss the right opportunity.

Let me know when you're ready."

*End of weak demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT WENT WRONG**

First, they accepted the pattern without addressing it. This is the fourth or fifth time—same response every time.

Second, they offered to send more information, which feeds the stall. Information overload isn't the problem.

Third, they created mild pressure—"market is moving," "hate to see you miss out"—which doesn't address why the investor is stuck.

Fourth, they committed to following up again next week, repeating the same cycle that hasn't worked for two months.

**STRONG DEMO**

*Consultant pauses, then speaks directly but kindly.*

"I appreciate that. Can I share an observation?

We've had several conversations over the past two months, and each time you've needed more thinking time. That's completely fine—but I'm wondering if there's something I'm not addressing.

Is there a specific concern that keeps coming up when you think about this? Something I haven't answered properly?

Or—and I ask this without any pressure—has your thinking actually led you toward 'no' but you haven't wanted to say it?

Either answer is fine. I'd just rather understand where we are than keep having the same conversation."

*Investor pauses: "Honestly... I'm not sure. I think I'm just nervous about making such a big decision. Every time I get close, I find a reason to wait."*

"That's really helpful to understand. What you're describing isn't unusual—property investment is significant, especially internationally.

Let me ask a different question: What would need to be true for you to feel confident? Not what information you need—you have plenty. What would need to be true about your circumstances, your readiness, the market?

Because if the issue is information, I can help. If the issue is timing or life circumstances, maybe the honest answer is 'not now.' And that's okay—I'd rather you wait until you're ready than push forward with doubts."

*End of strong demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT MADE IT WORK**

First, they named the pattern respectfully. "We've had several conversations... each time you've needed more thinking time." No accusation, just observation.

Second, they explored two possibilities—unaddressed concern or soft rejection. This opens space for honesty.

Third, they gave permission to say no. "Either answer is fine" removes the social pressure to keep pretending.

Fourth, when the investor revealed fear of big decisions, they reframed the question. Not "what information do you need?" but "what would need to be true?"

Fifth, they validated that "not now" might be the honest answer. This shows they prioritise the investor's genuine readiness over closing the deal.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version accepted the stall and perpetuated the cycle. The strong version gently broke the pattern, created space for honest conversation, and treated the investor's hesitation as something to understand, not overcome. One enables avoidance. The other facilitates clarity.
