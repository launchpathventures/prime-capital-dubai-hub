# Comparative Market Analysis

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **compare any properties using The Investment Score methodology**, present clear trade-offs, and confidently answer "Why this one over the other?"

---

## When Comparison Matters

Investors rarely buy the first property they see. They want to understand options, weigh trade-offs, and feel confident they've considered alternatives.

Comparative market analysis (CMA) structures this comparison. It moves the conversation from "Is this a good property?" to "Which property best fits my requirements?"

**The Prime Capital standard:** Every client receives a CMA before committing to a purchase.

---

## The Investment Score CMA Framework

Our comparative analysis uses three layers:

| Layer | What It Shows | Format |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **1. Data Matrix** | Side-by-side property facts | Table |
| **2. Investment Score** | Yield, appreciation, total return | Numbers |
| **3. Trade-off Analysis** | What you gain and give up | Narrative |

---

## Step 1: Define Comparison Criteria

Before comparing properties, agree on what matters. Use the investor's stated requirements from discovery.

### Core Comparison Criteria

| Category | Criteria | Weight |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Financial** | Price, price per sqft, gross yield, net yield, total return | High |
| **Location** | Area, proximity to metro/beach, established vs. emerging | High |
| **Property** | Size, layout, view, floor level, condition | Medium |
| **Building** | Developer, age, service charges, amenities | Medium |
| **Risk** | Ready vs. off-plan, developer track record, payment terms | Medium |
| **Liquidity** | Rental demand, resale potential | Medium |

**Not all criteria matter equally.** An investor focused on rental income cares more about yield than view. An investor planning to use the property cares more about view than yield.

---

## Step 2: Build the Comparison Matrix

A comparison matrix puts properties side by side against the criteria.

### Real Example: Marina 1BR vs JVC 2BR vs Downtown Studio

| Criteria | Marina 1BR | JVC 2BR | Downtown Studio |
|----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Price** | AED 1,350,000 | AED 1,100,000 | AED 1,450,000 |
| **Price/sqft** | AED 1,800 | AED 957 | AED 2,417 |
| **Size** | 750 sqft | 1,150 sqft | 600 sqft |
| **Bedrooms** | 1 | 2 | Studio |
| **View** | Marina view | Garden view | Boulevard view |
| **Floor** | 18/35 | 6/12 | 28/45 |
| **Status** | Ready | Ready | Ready |
| **Gross yield** | 7.6% | 8.2% | 6.2% |
| **Net yield** | 4.9% | 5.1% | 3.8% |
| **Service charge/sqft** | AED 16 | AED 12 | AED 22 |
| **Developer** | Select Group | Damac | Emaar |
| **Building age** | 5 years | 4 years | 7 years |
| **Resale liquidity** | High | Medium | Very High |

---

## Step 3: Calculate Investment Scores

For each property, calculate the full Investment Score:

### Marina 1BR Investment Score

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Purchase | | AED 1,350,000 |
| Annual rent | AED 8,500 × 12 | AED 102,000 |
| Gross yield | 102,000 / 1,350,000 | **7.6%** |
| Annual costs | Service + Mgmt + Vacancy + Maintenance | AED 35,920 |
| Net income | 102,000 - 35,920 | AED 66,080 |
| Net yield | 66,080 / 1,350,000 | **4.9%** |
| Projected appreciation | Conservative 6% | **6.0%** |
| **Total return** | 4.9% + 6.0% | **10.9%** |

### JVC 2BR Investment Score

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Purchase | | AED 1,100,000 |
| Annual rent | AED 7,500 × 12 | AED 90,000 |
| Gross yield | 90,000 / 1,100,000 | **8.2%** |
| Annual costs | Service + Mgmt + Vacancy + Maintenance | AED 34,020 |
| Net income | 90,000 - 34,020 | AED 55,980 |
| Net yield | 55,980 / 1,100,000 | **5.1%** |
| Projected appreciation | Conservative 4% | **4.0%** |
| **Total return** | 5.1% + 4.0% | **9.1%** |

### Downtown Studio Investment Score

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Purchase | | AED 1,450,000 |
| Annual rent | AED 7,500 × 12 | AED 90,000 |
| Gross yield | 90,000 / 1,450,000 | **6.2%** |
| Annual costs | Service + Mgmt + Vacancy + Maintenance | AED 41,000 |
| Net income | 90,000 - 41,000 | AED 49,000 |
| Net yield | 49,000 / 1,450,000 | **3.4%** |
| Projected appreciation | Conservative 7% | **7.0%** |
| **Total return** | 3.4% + 7.0% | **10.4%** |

### Summary Investment Scores

| Property | Net Yield | Appreciation | Total Return |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Marina 1BR | 4.9% | 6.0% | **10.9%** |
| JVC 2BR | 5.1% | 4.0% | **9.1%** |
| Downtown Studio | 3.4% | 7.0% | **10.4%** |

---

## Step 4: Apply the Risk-Reward Matrix

Match each property to a risk profile:

### Risk-Reward Analysis

| Property | Risk Level | Reward Profile | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Marina 1BR | Low-Medium | Balanced yield + growth | Conservative-Moderate investors |
| JVC 2BR | Low | High yield, moderate growth | Income-focused investors |
| Downtown Studio | Medium | Lower yield, high growth | Growth-focused investors |

### Why Client A Should Buy JVC, Client B Should Buy Marina

**Client A Profile:**
- First-time investor
- Wants steady income
- 10-year hold horizon
- Risk-averse
- Budget: AED 1.2M

**Recommendation: JVC 2BR**
"The JVC property offers the highest net yield at 5.1%, which means AED 55,980 in your pocket annually. It's under your budget with room to spare, the tenant profile is strong (families), and the lower entry point means less capital at risk. The trade-off is slower appreciation, but for a 10-year hold focused on income, that's acceptable."

**Client B Profile:**
- Experienced investor
- Portfolio diversification
- 5-year hold horizon
- Moderate risk tolerance
- Budget: AED 1.5M

**Recommendation: Marina 1BR**
"The Marina property offers stronger total return at 10.9% when you factor in appreciation. Marina has historically outperformed in resale, and the liquidity means you can exit in 5 years without difficulty. You're paying more per sqft, but you're buying a premium location with proven demand."

---

## Step 5: Present Trade-offs

The matrix shows data. Your analysis explains trade-offs.

### The Trade-off Narrative

"Looking across these three options, here's how I'd characterise the trade-offs:

**Marina 1BR** is the balanced choice. Premium location, solid yield at 4.9% net, strong resale liquidity. You're paying AED 1,800 per sqft — a premium — but Marina holds value and appreciates reliably. Best for investors who want a blend of income and capital preservation.

**JVC 2BR** is the yield play. Best net return at 5.1%, lowest entry cost, most space for your money. The trade-off is location prestige — JVC is solid but not as liquid as Marina for resale. Best for income-focused investors comfortable with longer holds.

**Downtown Studio** is the growth play. Lowest yield at 3.4%, highest price per sqft, but Downtown appreciation historically leads Dubai. You're buying location and prestige over immediate income. Best for investors prioritising capital appreciation who don't need cash flow."

---

## Handling "Why This One Over the Other?"

When clients ask this question, use the Investment Score framework:

### Sample Dialogue

<speak>
**Client:** "I keep going back and forth between the Marina and JVC properties. Why would you pick one over the other?"

**Consultant:** "Great question. Let me break it down using the numbers and then give you my view.

On yield, JVC wins: 5.1% net versus 4.9% for Marina. That's about ten thousand dirhams more per year in your pocket.

On total return, Marina wins: 10.9% versus 9.1% when you factor in appreciation. Marina has a stronger track record for price growth.

On liquidity, Marina wins again. When you want to sell, Marina properties move faster and command better prices per square foot.

On entry cost, JVC wins by two hundred fifty thousand dirhams. That's capital you could deploy elsewhere or keep as reserve.

So here's how I'd think about it: If you're optimising for cash flow and don't need to sell within five years, JVC makes sense. If you're optimising for total return and want exit flexibility, Marina is worth the premium.

What matters more to you — the monthly income or the eventual sale price?"

## Written CMA Report

For significant decisions, provide a written comparison. This becomes a reference document and demonstrates professionalism.

### Report Structure

**1. Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
Brief overview of what was analysed and headline recommendation.

**2. Investor Requirements** (bullet list)
Confirmed criteria from discovery.

**3. Properties Analysed** (1 paragraph each)
Brief description of each property with key attributes.

**4. Comparison Matrix** (table)
Side-by-side data comparison.

**5. Investment Score Summary** (table)
Net yield, appreciation, total return for each.

**6. Trade-off Analysis** (2-3 paragraphs)
Your interpretation of what the data means.

**7. Risk-Reward Assessment** (table)
Match each property to investor risk profile.

**8. Recommendation** (1-2 paragraphs)
Your view on the best fit for this investor, with rationale.

**9. Next Steps** (bullet list)
What happens if they want to proceed.

### Sample Executive Summary

"This analysis compares three properties — a Marina 1BR, JVC 2BR, and Downtown Studio — assessed against your requirements for rental yield (target 5%+), capital preservation, and ease of management from abroad.

The JVC property offers the strongest net yield at 5.1% and lowest entry cost. The Marina property provides better total return (10.9%) and resale liquidity at a premium price point. The Downtown studio offers highest appreciation potential but lowest yield.

Based on your emphasis on balanced returns and 5-year liquidity, I recommend the Marina 1BR as the best fit. The yield is marginally lower than JVC (0.2%), but the location quality protects your capital and ensures reliable tenant demand."

---

## When to Recommend Against All Options

Sometimes the honest answer is: none of these is right.

**Examples:**

"Based on what you're looking for, I don't think any of these three hit the mark. The yields don't justify the prices in the current market cycle. I'd recommend we wait for the next developer launch in March when pricing will be more competitive."

"These are all solid properties, but they're stretching your budget in ways that concern me. The handover payments would leave you with no reserve. I think we should look at the 1-bedroom options we discussed as a backup."

**Why this works:** Recommending against a transaction protects your credibility. Investors remember advisors who told them to wait — and they come back.

## The Payment Plan Calculator in CMA

When comparing off-plan vs ready, include payment plan impact:

### Off-Plan vs Ready CMA Example

| Factor | Ready (JVC 2BR) | Off-Plan (Creek Harbour) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Launch price | N/A | AED 1,300,000 |
| Current price | AED 1,100,000 | N/A |
| Payment plan | Cash or mortgage | 60/40 over 2 years |
| Year 1 capital deployed | AED 1,100,000 | AED 520,000 |
| Year 1 income | AED 55,980 | AED 0 |
| Year 2 income | AED 55,980 | AED 0 |
| Handover value (projected) | N/A | AED 1,560,000 |
| 2-year gain on cash | AED 111,960 (10.2%) | AED 260,000 (50% on deployed) |

**The trade-off:** Off-plan offers higher ROI on capital deployed (leverage effect) but requires waiting for income and carries construction risk.

## Common CMA Mistakes

### 1. Comparing Too Many Properties
More than 4-5 properties creates decision paralysis. Filter to a shortlist first.

### 2. Unequal Information
Comparing a property you've researched thoroughly against one with estimated figures is unfair and misleading.

### 3. Hiding Weaknesses
If one property has a clear weakness, stating it builds trust. Concealing it damages credibility when discovered.

### 4. Leading the Decision
"Property A is clearly the best choice" removes investor agency. "Based on your stated priorities, Property A appears to fit best" acknowledges they decide.

### 5. Ignoring Soft Factors
Numbers matter, but so do intangibles. How does the investor feel in each building? The gut reaction informs good decisions too.
