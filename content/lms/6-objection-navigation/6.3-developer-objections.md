# Developer & Project Objections

## Introduction

"What if the developer doesn't deliver?" "I've heard about delays." "How do I know the quality will be what they're promising?"

Developer and project objections are particularly common with off-plan purchases, where investors are committing capital before they can see, touch, or inspect what they're buying. These objections deserve serious attention—they represent real risks.

Your role is to help investors assess these risks accurately, understand the protections that exist, and make informed decisions about which projects merit confidence.

## The Core Fear

Behind developer objections lies a fear of betrayal: "I'll trust them with my money and they'll let me down."

This manifests as:
- **Delivery concern**: "They won't finish the project"
- **Timeline concern**: "It will take much longer than promised"
- **Quality concern**: "What I receive won't match what was promised"
- **Financial concern**: "My payments won't be protected"

## Common Objections and Responses

### "What if the developer goes bankrupt?"

**What they're really asking:** Is my money protected if things go wrong?

**Exploration questions:**
- "Have you had experience with off-plan purchases elsewhere?"
- "Are you familiar with how escrow accounts work in Dubai?"
- "Is this concern about a specific developer or off-plan generally?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"That's a legitimate concern, especially given what happened in 2008-2009 when some developers did fail.

Since then, RERA has implemented mandatory escrow requirements:
- All buyer payments must go into a dedicated project escrow account
- The developer cannot access these funds freely—they're released based on construction progress
- A RERA-approved project consultant must verify milestones before funds are released
- If a project is cancelled, buyers have first claim on the escrow funds

This doesn't eliminate all risk—if a project fails mid-construction, there may be complexities in recovering funds. But it's materially different from pre-2009 when developers could use buyer money however they wished.

For established developers with multiple completed projects, bankruptcy risk is lower. For newer developers or more speculative projects, the risk profile is different. Which category is the project you're considering?"

### "I've heard about developers delaying for years."

**What they're really asking:** Will I actually receive my property when promised?

**Exploration questions:**
- "What have you heard specifically?"
- "Is on-time delivery critical for your plans?"
- "Are you comparing this to other markets where you've invested?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Delays do happen. I want to be honest about that.

The causes vary:
- **Supply chain issues**: Material shortages, shipping delays
- **Labour availability**: During peak construction periods
- **Design changes**: Sometimes investor-requested, sometimes developer-initiated
- **Regulatory approvals**: Permit processes can extend timelines
- **Market conditions**: In slower markets, developers may slow construction

What's changed since the early days:
- RERA requires registered project timelines
- Developers face penalties for significant delays
- Buyers have rights if delays exceed contractual grace periods

That said, it's wise to plan for delays. A handover date of Q4 2026 might realistically mean Q2 2027. If that timing breaks your investment case, we should discuss it honestly.

For the specific developer you're considering, I can show you their track record. Have they delivered projects on time? Late? How late? That history is more predictive than promises."

### "How do I know the quality will match the show apartment?"

**What they're really asking:** Will I be disappointed with reality?

**Exploration questions:**
- "Have you seen the show apartment?"
- "Are there specific finishes or features you're concerned about?"
- "Have you looked at completed projects by this developer?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Show apartments are, by design, aspirational. They're professionally staged with premium furniture and lighting designed to showcase potential. What you actually receive may feel different.

There are two ways to assess this:

First, the SPA (Sales and Purchase Agreement) specifies exactly what's included—appliances, finishes, fixtures. This is your contractual protection. If the delivered unit doesn't match SPA specifications, you have recourse.

Second, and more importantly, visit completed projects by the same developer. How do their 3-year-old buildings look? How are residents describing their experience? A developer's completed portfolio tells you more than any show apartment.

For [specific developer], I can arrange visits to their completed buildings. Seeing actual units, not showrooms, will give you a realistic expectation."

### "I don't know this developer. Can I trust them?"

**What they're really asking:** Should I take a risk on an unknown entity?

**Exploration questions:**
- "What would help you feel confident about a developer?"
- "Are you open to researching their background?"
- "Would you be more comfortable with a master developer's project?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Developer due diligence is essential. Here's what I recommend:

**Track record:**
- How many projects have they completed in Dubai?
- Were they delivered on time?
- What do residents say about the properties and management?

**Financial backing:**
- Who are the shareholders?
- Do they have strong financial partners?
- What's their funding model?

**Regulatory standing:**
- Is the project registered with RERA?
- Has the developer had disputes or penalties?

For lesser-known developers, I'd suggest extra caution. The discount they may offer reflects higher risk. If you're more risk-averse, master developers (Emaar, Dubai Properties, Meraas, Dubai Holding) or established private developers (Damac, Select Group, Ellington) have longer track records.

There's nothing wrong with preferring established names. The premium you pay is essentially risk reduction."

### "What happens if I want to exit before completion?"

**What they're really asking:** Am I locked in?

**Exploration questions:**
- "Is flexibility important to your investment strategy?"
- "Are you anticipating circumstances that might require early exit?"
- "Have you considered the resale market for off-plan?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Off-plan properties can be resold before completion, but there are constraints:

**Developer consent:**
Most developers require approval for resales. Some charge transfer fees (2-4% of purchase price). Some restrict resales until a certain percentage is paid (often 40%).

**Market conditions:**
If the market has appreciated, you may sell at a profit. If it's softened, you may take a loss. Off-plan resale prices reflect current market sentiment about the project and completion timeline.

**Process:**
Resales typically happen through the developer or authorised brokers. The original contract is novated to the new buyer.

If flexibility is essential to you, I'd suggest either:
- Choosing ready properties where exit is cleaner
- Selecting highly liquid projects from premium developers where resale demand is stronger
- Ensuring you're comfortable holding to completion

Being locked in isn't inherently bad—it just needs to match your actual situation."

## Coach Walkthrough

### Scenario: The Developer Doubter

**Setup:** An investor is interested in a project from a developer with limited track record in Dubai.

**Investor says:** "I like the project, but I've never heard of this developer. My friend bought from a developer nobody knew in 2007 and lost everything."

**Strong response:**

*Pause. This isn't just intellectual—it's emotional. Someone they know got hurt.*

"I'm sorry to hear about your friend's experience. That happened to many people in 2008-2009, and it was devastating.

Can I ask—do you know which developer that was, and what went wrong?"

*Investor shares details or says they don't know specifics.*

"The 2008 period was particularly problematic because there were minimal protections. Today's framework is different—escrow accounts, RERA registration, construction-linked payment plans.

That said, you're right to be cautious with newer developers. Let me suggest an approach:

First, let's look at this developer's background. Who are the principals? What have they done before Dubai? Do they have financial backing?

Second, let's check their RERA registration and project escrow details.

Third, if after that research you're still uncomfortable, we can look at similar projects from established developers. Peace of mind has value.

Would you like to do that due diligence together?"

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges the emotional reality
- Doesn't dismiss their concern
- Offers a structured approach to evaluate
- Presents alternatives without abandoning the option

### Scenario: Delay Anxiety

**Setup:** An investor needs to relocate in 18 months and is considering an off-plan project with a 15-month completion timeline.

**Investor says:** "The timeline looks tight. What if there are delays and I have nowhere to live?"

**Strong response:**

"Let me be direct: with a 15-month timeline and a hard deadline at 18 months, you have almost no buffer. Delays happen more often than not.

Three options:

One, we find a ready property. You know exactly what you're getting and when. The price per square foot may be higher, but you eliminate timeline risk.

Two, we find a project that's much further along—say, 3-6 months from handover. Less time for things to go wrong.

Three, we proceed with this project but you plan accommodation alternatives for the gap. If that gap might be 6-12 months, is that acceptable?

Given your situation, I'd actually recommend option one or two. Off-plan timelines are estimates, not guarantees. If being housed on schedule is non-negotiable, don't bet on off-plan timing."

**Why this works:**
- Directly addresses the risk
- Doesn't minimise the concern
- Provides concrete alternatives
- Prioritises the investor's actual needs over the sale

## Key Takeaways

- Developer objections stem from fear of betrayal—being let down after trusting with capital
- Escrow protections are real but not absolute—explain them accurately
- Delays happen—set realistic expectations rather than optimistic promises
- Quality concerns can be addressed by visiting completed projects
- Developer reputation matters—don't push clients toward developers you wouldn't trust yourself
- When timeline is critical, off-plan may not be the right choice—say so
