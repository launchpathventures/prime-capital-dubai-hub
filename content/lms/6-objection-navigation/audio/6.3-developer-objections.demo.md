**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of handling a developer trust objection. An investor is interested in a project from a developer with limited track record in Dubai. They've just said: "I like the project, but I've never heard of this developer. My friend bought from a developer nobody knew in 2007 and lost everything."

**WEAK DEMO**

*Consultant responds quickly:*

"Oh, don't worry about that. This developer is really good—they have backing from some major investors. The project is fully registered with RERA, so your money is protected.

What happened in 2007 was different. The market was crazy then. Now everything is regulated. Escrow accounts protect all your payments.

Plus, the location is amazing and the pricing is below market. If you wait, the best units will be gone. I have three other clients looking at the same tower.

Your friend's situation was unfortunate, but that won't happen today. The developers I work with are all reliable. I wouldn't show you something I didn't believe in."

*End of weak demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT WENT WRONG**

First, they dismissed the emotional weight of the friend's experience. "Don't worry about that" minimises something that clearly matters to this investor.

Second, they gave vague reassurances—"major investors," "really good," "reliable"—without any specific evidence about this developer's track record.

Third, they created pressure with "best units will be gone" and "three other clients looking." This feels like sales tactics, not guidance.

Fourth, they never explored what specific due diligence would make this investor comfortable. What would they need to see?

**STRONG DEMO**

*Consultant pauses. This isn't just intellectual—it's emotional.*

"I'm sorry to hear about your friend's experience. That happened to many people in 2008-2009, and it was devastating.

Can I ask—do you know which developer that was, and what went wrong?"

*Investor: "I don't know all the details. Just that they paid deposits and the project never got built. They lost a lot of money."*

"That was unfortunately common. The 2008 period was particularly problematic because there were minimal protections. Today's framework is different—escrow accounts, RERA registration, construction-linked payment plans.

That said, you're right to be cautious with newer developers. Let me suggest an approach.

First, let's look at this developer's background together. Who are the principals? What have they done before Dubai? Do they have financial backing?

Second, let's verify their RERA registration and check the project escrow details. I can show you how to confirm your payments would be protected.

Third—and this is important—if after that research you're still uncomfortable, we can look at similar projects from established developers. Emaar, Meraas, Select Group, Ellington—they have longer track records.

There's nothing wrong with preferring established names. The premium you pay is essentially risk reduction. Peace of mind has value.

Would you like to do that due diligence together? I'd rather you feel confident than pressured."

*End of strong demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT MADE IT WORK**

First, they acknowledged the emotional reality. "I'm sorry to hear about your friend's experience" shows empathy before problem-solving.

Second, they explored to understand the specific situation. What happened? This helps calibrate the response.

Third, they explained regulatory changes factually—escrow accounts, RERA registration—without overselling the protection.

Fourth, they offered a structured due diligence approach. Here's how we can verify together—background, registration, escrow.

Fifth, they presented alternatives without abandoning the option. "If you're still uncomfortable, we can look at established developers." This shows the investor's comfort matters more than this particular sale.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version tried to overcome emotional concern with vague reassurance and urgency. The strong version honoured the emotional weight, offered a structured path to confidence, and presented alternatives if confidence doesn't come. One prioritises the transaction. The other prioritises the investor.
