Welcome to Secondary Market Evaluation — where you'll learn to assess resale properties systematically.

The secondary market means ready properties — completed, often tenanted, with a track record you can evaluate. What you see is what you get. No construction risk, no waiting, no renders versus reality.

In this module, you'll learn to evaluate secondary properties across five dimensions: physical condition, building management, pricing assessment, seller motivation, and rental performance.

You'll understand the trade-offs between secondary and off-plan. Higher entry prices but immediate income. Less payment flexibility but no construction risk. Known performance versus projections.

Most importantly, you'll learn to use actual data. A property with a consistent tenant at one hundred twenty thousand per year is more valuable than a similar property with estimated rent of one hundred thirty thousand that's been vacant.

By the end, you'll assess secondary opportunities with the same rigour you apply to off-plan — matching the right type of property to the right investor profile.

Let's get into the evaluation process.
