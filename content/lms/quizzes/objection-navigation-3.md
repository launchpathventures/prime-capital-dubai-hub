questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What is the most professional way to handle being told a client purchased through another agent?"
    options:
      - text: "Ask why you lost to understand what went wrong"
        correct: false
      - text: "Offer to match whatever the other agent provided"
        correct: false
      - text: "Stay gracious, congratulate them, and keep the door open for future"
        correct: true
      - text: "Point out potential issues with the other agent's service"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Stay gracious when you lose. Congratulate them on their purchase, keep the door open for future opportunities, and process your feelings privately. Asking why rarely produces honest answers and can seem defensive."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When a client 'ghosts' you after 4 viewings, what's the recommended approach?"
    options:
      - text: "Send multiple messages in quick succession to re-engage"
        correct: false
      - text: "Send one follow-up after a week, one more with an easy out, then stop active pursuit"
        correct: true
      - text: "Call their personal contacts to find out what happened"
        correct: false
      - text: "Create urgency by saying the property won't last"
        correct: false
    explanation: "After ghosting: one straightforward message after a week, one more with an easy exit option after 2-3 weeks, then stop active pursuit. Multiple rapid messages or artificial urgency will push them further away."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When a deal falls through at the NOC stage, what should you do first?"
    options:
      - text: "Blame the other party to your client"
        correct: false
      - text: "Immediately start showing alternative properties"
        correct: false
      - text: "Document everything and explain the refund process to your client"
        correct: true
      - text: "Disappear until the situation resolves"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When deals fall through late: document everything (for protection and learning), explain next steps including refund process to your client, and be present during the difficult time rather than disappearing."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When a developer delays handover and your client is frustrated, what should you NOT do?"
    options:
      - text: "Acknowledge their frustration"
        correct: false
      - text: "Offer to reach out to the developer for updates"
        correct: false
      - text: "Accept blame for the delay"
        correct: true
      - text: "Manage expectations about what you can control"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Don't accept blame that isn't yours. The delay is the developer's responsibility, not yours. Acknowledge frustration, clarify your role, provide support where you can, but don't take responsibility for things outside your control."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What daily resilience practice helps prevent rumination after setbacks?"
    options:
      - text: "Morning intention setting and end-of-day review"
        correct: true
      - text: "Analysing every lost deal in detail before sleeping"
        correct: false
      - text: "Avoiding all thoughts about work after hours"
        correct: false
      - text: "Setting higher targets for the next day"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Setting morning intention (not targets) and doing a 5-minute end-of-day review (what went well, what to improve, what to be grateful for) prevents rumination and builds learning habits."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When should you use the 'Permission to Close' technique?"
    options:
      - text: "As soon as an investor expresses interest"
        correct: false
      - text: "When you need to hit your monthly target"
        correct: false
      - text: "After extended engagement with no clear progress"
        correct: true
      - text: "Every time an investor asks for thinking time"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Permission to Close is appropriate after extended engagement with no clear progress, when the investor seems stuck but not unwilling, and when both parties would benefit from clarity. It's not a pressure tactic."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the key phrase in the Permission to Close script?"
    options:
      - text: "You need to make a decision now"
        correct: false
      - text: "Either answer is better than staying in limbo"
        correct: true
      - text: "Time is running out on this opportunity"
        correct: false
      - text: "I need to know your answer today"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The Permission to Close technique works because it validates either answer. 'Either answer is better than staying in limbo' gives the investor permission to say no without awkwardness, which paradoxically makes yes more possible."

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "After a significant deal falls through, what should you do on the same day?"
    options:
      - text: "Immediately reach out to the client for feedback"
        correct: false
      - text: "Feel what you feel and don't make major decisions while emotional"
        correct: true
      - text: "Update all your processes to prevent it happening again"
        correct: false
      - text: "Contact the next prospect to recover momentum"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Same day after a loss: feel your feelings (disappointment, frustration), talk to someone if helpful, but don't make major decisions or communications while emotional. Document and learn the next day, not immediately."

  - id: "q9"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What percentage of qualified leads typically result in purchases, even for excellent consultants?"
    options:
      - text: "50-60%"
        correct: false
      - text: "70-80%"
        correct: false
      - text: "20-30%"
        correct: true
      - text: "90%+"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Even excellent consultants see only 20-30% of qualified leads eventually purchase. This means 3-5 'failures' for every success. Understanding this reality helps build appropriate expectations and resilience."

  - id: "q10"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the purpose of documenting 'wins' weekly?"
    options:
      - text: "To track performance for compensation purposes"
        correct: false
      - text: "To counterbalance negativity bias"
        correct: true
      - text: "To prepare reports for management"
        correct: false
      - text: "To compare yourself to other consultants"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Documenting weekly wins (3 things that went well, 1 thing learned, 1 relationship strengthened) counterbalances negativity bias—our natural tendency to focus on failures rather than successes."
