# Dubai Economic Vision

## Introduction

Sophisticated investors want to understand the fundamentals driving a market, not just current prices. Dubai's real estate story is inseparable from its economic transformation strategy. This module covers the key initiatives shaping Dubai's future—and why they matter for property investment.

## Economic Diversification

### The Transformation Story

**Historical Dependency**: In the 1970s, Dubai's economy was nearly 100% dependent on oil revenue.

**Today's Reality**: Oil and gas now represent less than **1%** of Dubai's GDP.

**Current Economic Mix**:

| Sector | GDP Contribution |
|--------|------------------|
| Wholesale & Retail Trade | 26% |
| Real Estate & Construction | 22% |
| Financial Services | 11% |
| Transport & Storage | 11% |
| Tourism & Hospitality | 10% |
| Manufacturing | 9% |
| Other Services | 11% |

This diversification makes Dubai's economy resilient to oil price fluctuations—a key differentiator from other Gulf states.

### Economic Growth Trajectory
