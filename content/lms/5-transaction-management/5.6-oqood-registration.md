# Oqood Registration

## Introduction

Oqood (عقود) is the Arabic word for "contracts." In Dubai real estate, Oqood registration refers to the official registration of off-plan Sales and Purchase Agreements with the Dubai Land Department (DLD). This registration provides crucial legal protection for buyers.

Understanding Oqood—why it matters, how it works, and what it provides—is essential for advising off-plan investors.

## What is Oqood?

### Definition

Oqood is the system through which off-plan property contracts are registered with the Dubai Land Department before the property is completed and a title deed can be issued.

### Purpose

**Oqood registration provides:**
1. **Official recognition** of buyer's interest in the property
2. **Protection against double-selling** — developer can't sell the same unit twice
3. **Basis for eventual title deed** — registration converts to title at handover
4. **Mortgage eligibility** — banks require Oqood for off-plan financing
5. **Secondary market transfer** — Oqood can be transferred to another buyer

### Before Oqood Existed

Prior to Oqood implementation, buyers had only their SPA as proof of purchase. Unscrupulous developers could:
- Sell the same unit to multiple buyers
- Use buyer funds for other projects
- Disappear without delivering properties

Oqood eliminated most of these risks by creating government oversight of off-plan transactions.

|-------|-------------------|----------|
| SPA signed | Buyer and Developer | Day 0 |
| Developer prepares documents | Developer | 1-7 days |
| Registration submitted | Developer | Within 30 days of SPA |
| DLD processing | Dubai Land Department | 14-30 days |
| Oqood certificate issued | DLD | Upon completion |
| Certificate provided to buyer | Developer/Agent | Within 7 days of issue |

**Total Timeline:** 30-60 days from SPA signing

### Step-by-Step Process

## Oqood Costs

### Standard Fees

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| DLD Registration Fee | 4% of purchase price | May be split buyer/seller |
| Admin/Trustee Fee | AED 4,000-5,000 | Plus VAT |
| Knowledge Fee | AED 10 | DLD standard fee |
| Innovation Fee | AED 10 | DLD standard fee |

### Fee Payment Timing

**Options:**
1. **At SPA signing:** Full fees paid upfront
2. **At Oqood registration:** Fees paid when registration submitted
3. **Split payments:** Partial at SPA, balance at registration

**Common Practice:** Most developers collect DLD fees at or shortly after SPA signing.

### Who Pays?

**Standard market practice:**
- DLD 4% fee: Split 2% buyer, 2% seller (developer)
- Admin fees: Typically paid by buyer
- Some developers offer "zero DLD fee" promotions (they absorb buyer's share)

**Check each transaction:** Fee responsibility varies by developer and promotion.
