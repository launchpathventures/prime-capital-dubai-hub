# Certification Assessment Rubric
## Prime Capital Consultant Readiness Scoring

**Version:** 1.0

---

## How to Use This Rubric

Score each dimension from **1-5** based on what you observe during the assessment. Use the specific behaviours described, but trust your professional judgement. The descriptions guide scoring — they don't replace your assessment of overall readiness.

After scoring all five dimensions, calculate the average and apply the decision criteria at the end.

## Decision Criteria

### Pass Criteria (ALL must be met)

✅ Average score ≥ **3.5**  
✅ No single dimension below **2**  
✅ No brand/tone concerns that would embarrass Prime Capital  
✅ Evaluator confidence: "I would introduce them to my clients"

### Automatic Needs Development

❌ Average score below **3.5**  
❌ Any dimension scored **1**  
❌ More than one dimension scored **2**  
❌ Serious brand/tone concerns  
❌ Evaluator gut feeling: "Not yet ready"

### Edge Cases (Use Judgement)

**Score is 3.4-3.6 with one dimension at 2:**  
Consider the specific dimension. Process expertise at 2 might be addressable quickly. Composure at 2 is more concerning. Discuss with another founder if unsure.

**Strong scores but something felt "off":**  
Trust your gut. The rubric is a guide, not a replacement for professional judgement. If you wouldn't send them to a client, they need more development.

**Nervous candidate who knows their stuff:**  
Nerves are normal and don't automatically mean low scores. Look for whether they recovered and whether knowledge showed through the nerves.
