# Off-Plan Sales & Escrow

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **accurately answer RERA exam questions** about off-plan sale regulations, Oqood registration, escrow account rules, and developer obligations under Dubai law.

---

## Why This Matters for the Exam

Off-plan sales represent a significant portion of Dubai's real estate market. RERA places strong emphasis on buyer protection in off-plan transactions, making this a heavily tested topic.

**Exam frequency:** 10-15 questions per exam involve off-plan rules, escrow requirements, or developer obligations.

## Critical Numbers to Memorize

> ⚠️ **EXAM CRITICAL:** These numbers are tested repeatedly. Memorize them exactly.

| Rule | Percentage/Number | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Termination Forfeiture (at 60%+ construction)** | **40%** maximum | Law 6 of 2019 |
| **Termination Forfeiture (below 60% construction)** | **25%** maximum | Of payments made |
| **Oqood Registration Fee** | **4%** of property value | Same as transfer fee |
| **Escrow Account Requirement** | **100%** of buyer payments | All payments to escrow |
| **Minimum Construction Progress for Launch** | **20%** | Before sales can begin |
| **Project Completion Deadline** | **As per SPA** | Must be specified |

### Memory Trick: "40-60-25"

- **40%** maximum forfeiture when construction is at **60%** or more
- **25%** maximum forfeiture when construction is below 60%

## Oqood Registration System

### What is Oqood?

Oqood (Arabic for "contracts") is DLD's system for registering off-plan property sales contracts. It provides:

- Legal protection for buyers
- Proof of ownership rights
- Transaction transparency
- Developer accountability

### Registration Requirements

**Mandatory Registration:**
- All off-plan sale contracts must be registered
- Within 60 days of signing SPA
- Developer is responsible for registration

**Registration Fee:**
- 4% of property value (same as transfer fee)
- Paid by buyer (typically)
- Registered against developer's project

### Exam Tip: Oqood vs Title Deed

**Common Question:** "What document does a buyer receive for an off-plan purchase?"

- **Before completion:** Oqood certificate (registered interest)
- **After completion:** Title deed (full ownership)

Don't confuse these—title deeds are only issued for completed properties.

## Law 6 of 2019: Buyer Protection Framework

### Key Provisions

Law 6 of 2019 governs off-plan property sales in Dubai. It replaced Law 13 of 2008 with enhanced buyer protections.

### Termination and Forfeiture Rules

> ⚠️ **MOST TESTED TOPIC:** Know these percentages exactly.

**If Construction Progress ≥ 60%:**
- Developer may forfeit **maximum 40%** of amounts paid
- Remaining 60% must be refunded to buyer

**If Construction Progress < 60%:**
- Developer may forfeit **maximum 25%** of amounts paid
- Remaining 75% must be refunded to buyer

**If Construction Not Started:**
- Developer may forfeit **maximum 25%** of amounts paid
- Or the actual administrative costs (whichever is lower)

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** Buyer has paid AED 1,000,000. Construction is at 65% complete. Buyer terminates.

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Maximum forfeiture (40%) | AED 400,000 |
| Minimum refund (60%) | AED 600,000 |

**Scenario:** Buyer has paid AED 1,000,000. Construction is at 45% complete. Buyer terminates.

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Maximum forfeiture (25%) | AED 250,000 |
| Minimum refund (75%) | AED 750,000 |

## Escrow Account Requirements

### What is an Escrow Account?

An escrow account is a special bank account that holds buyer payments until construction milestones are met. This protects buyers from:

- Developer misuse of funds
- Project abandonment
- Diversion of funds to other projects

### Mandatory Requirements

**1. All Projects Must Have Escrow**
- Registered with DLD
- Held at approved bank
- Separate account per project

**2. All Buyer Payments Go to Escrow**
- 100% of payments
- No exceptions
- Direct payment to escrow, not developer

**3. Releases Based on Construction Progress**
- Funds released in stages
- Based on certified construction progress
- Independent engineer certification required

### Escrow Release Schedule (Typical)

| Construction Stage | Typical Release |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Enabling works | 20% |
| Ground floor | 10% |
| Structural completion | 20% |
| Block work/MEP | 20% |
| Finishes | 15% |
| Handover | 15% |

**Note:** Actual schedules vary by project and developer.

### Exam Tip: Escrow Questions

**Common Question Patterns:**

1. "Who manages the escrow account?"
   - **Answer:** Bank approved by DLD, developer is account holder

2. "Can developers access escrow funds freely?"
   - **Answer:** No, funds are released based on construction progress

3. "What percentage of buyer payments must go to escrow?"
   - **Answer:** 100%

## Common Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Forfeiture Percentages

**Question Pattern:** "What is the maximum forfeiture for a buyer who terminates when construction is 70% complete?"

- ✅ **Correct:** 40% (construction ≥ 60%)
- ❌ **Wrong:** 25% (that's for construction < 60%)
- ❌ **Wrong:** 30% (this percentage doesn't exist in the law)

### Trap 2: Oqood vs Transfer Fee

**Question Pattern:** "What is the Oqood registration fee?"

- ✅ **Correct:** 4% of property value
- The fee is the same as the transfer fee—don't assume it's different

### Trap 3: Escrow Account Control

**Question Pattern:** "Who controls the escrow account?"

- The **bank** holds the account
- The **developer** is the account holder
- **DLD** regulates and oversees
- Funds are released based on **construction progress**, not developer request

### Trap 4: When Can Sales Begin?

**Question Pattern:** "When can a developer start selling off-plan units?"

- Must have RERA approval
- Must have escrow account
- Most projects require **20% construction completion**
- Some projects may start earlier with special approval

## Practice Questions

### Question 1

Under Law 6 of 2019, what is the maximum amount a developer can forfeit if a buyer terminates when construction is at 75% completion?

- A) 25% of amounts paid
- B) 30% of amounts paid
- C) 40% of amounts paid
- D) 50% of amounts paid

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C) 40% of amounts paid**

When construction progress is 60% or more, the developer may forfeit a maximum of 40% of the amounts paid by the buyer. Since 75% > 60%, the 40% maximum applies.

</details>

### Question 2

Which statement about escrow accounts is CORRECT?

- A) Developers can withdraw funds at any time
- B) 80% of buyer payments must go to escrow
- C) All buyer payments must go to escrow
- D) Escrow accounts are optional for developers

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C) All buyer payments must go to escrow**

100% of buyer payments for off-plan properties must be deposited into the project's escrow account. This is mandatory, not optional, and developers cannot withdraw freely—releases are based on construction progress.

</details>

### Question 3

What is the Oqood registration fee?

- A) 2% of property value
- B) 4% of property value
- C) AED 5,000 fixed
- D) 0.25% of property value

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B) 4% of property value**

The Oqood registration fee is 4% of the property value, the same rate as the standard DLD transfer fee.

</details>

### Question 4

A buyer has paid AED 800,000 for an off-plan property. Construction is at 50% when the buyer terminates. What is the MINIMUM amount the buyer must receive back?

- A) AED 200,000
- B) AED 480,000
- C) AED 600,000
- D) AED 320,000

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C) AED 600,000**

When construction is below 60%, the developer can forfeit maximum 25%. Therefore:
- Maximum forfeiture: 25% × AED 800,000 = AED 200,000
- Minimum refund: 75% × AED 800,000 = AED 600,000

</details>

### Question 5

Which of the following is a mandatory requirement before a developer can start off-plan sales?

- A) 100% construction completion
- B) Escrow account establishment with DLD-approved bank
- C) Full payment from at least one buyer
- D) Title deed issuance for all units

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B) Escrow account establishment with DLD-approved bank**

Before launching off-plan sales, developers must establish an escrow account with a DLD-approved bank. This is one of several mandatory requirements including RERA registration and sales permit.

</details>

### Question 6

What document does a buyer receive upon purchasing an off-plan property?

- A) Title deed
- B) Oqood certificate
- C) Sales permit
- D) Completion certificate

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>
