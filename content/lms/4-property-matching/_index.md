# Property Matching

## Overview

Property matching is where expertise translates into value. An investor may know they want Dubai real estate — your job is to find the specific opportunity that fits their capital, timeline, and objectives.

This competency builds on client discovery. You've understood what the investor wants. Now you need to systematically evaluate options using **named frameworks** and present them in a way that builds confidence.

## Named Frameworks in This Competency

| Framework | Purpose | Used In |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **The 3-Factor Property Match** | Systematic property evaluation | 4.1 Property Analysis |
| **The Investment Score** | Yield + appreciation calculation | 4.2 Yield Calculations |
| **The Risk-Reward Matrix** | Match properties to risk profiles | 4.2, 4.7 |
| **The Payment Plan Calculator** | Compare payment structure ROI | 4.4 Payment Plans |
| **The Developer Due Diligence Checklist** | Off-plan risk assessment | 4.3 Off-Plan Evaluation |

## Why This Matters

Poor property matching creates three problems:

1. **Wasted time** — Showing properties that don't fit the brief signals you weren't listening
2. **Lost trust** — Recommending unsuitable properties makes investors question your judgement
3. **Missed opportunities** — Failing to identify the right property means someone else closes the deal

Strong property matching creates lasting relationships. When you consistently find properties that align with investor goals, you become their trusted advisor — not just for this transaction, but for future portfolio decisions.

## What You'll Learn

This competency covers seven modules with practical, calculation-based content:

| Module | Focus | Named Framework | Duration |
|--------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 4.1 Property Analysis | Systematic evaluation | The 3-Factor Property Match | 25 min |
| 4.2 Yield & ROI | Calculations with real examples | The Investment Score | 35 min |
| 4.3 Off-Plan Evaluation | Risk assessment | Developer Due Diligence Checklist | 25 min |
| 4.4 Payment Plans | 60/40 vs 80/20 comparison | The Payment Plan Calculator | 25 min |
| 4.5 Secondary Market | Ready property assessment | — | 20 min |
| 4.6 Presentation | Building confidence | Coach Walkthrough | 30 min |
| 4.7 Comparative Analysis | Side-by-side evaluation | Risk-Reward Matrix | 35 min |

## Real Calculations You'll Master

By completing this competency, you'll be able to perform these calculations from memory:

**Yield Calculations:**
- Gross yield formula: `Annual Rent / Purchase Price × 100`
- Net yield with real service charge data
- Total return: `Net Yield + Capital Appreciation`

**Real Examples Covered:**
- Marina 1BR vs JVC 2BR yield comparison
- Branded vs standard building service charge impact
- Off-plan vs ready ROI on capital deployed
- 60/40 vs 80/20 payment plan cash flow analysis

## Behaviours We're Building

After completing this competency, you should be able to:

- **Apply The 3-Factor Property Match** to any property in under 10 minutes
- **Calculate Investment Scores** with gross yield, net yield, and total return
- **Use the Risk-Reward Matrix** to match client risk profiles to property types
- **Explain payment structures** using The Payment Plan Calculator methodology
- **Present properties** that demonstrate you've listened and understood the brief
- **Answer "Why this one?"** with data, not opinion

## How This Connects

This competency works alongside:

- **Client Discovery** — You can't match properties without understanding requirements
- **Transaction Management** — The properties you recommend must be executable
- **Objection Navigation** — Many objections arise from poor property matching

## Assessment

Complete all seven modules and pass two knowledge checks:
- **Property Matching Quiz 1** (after module 4.2) — Yield calculations and Investment Score
- **Property Matching Quiz 2** (after module 4.4) — Payment plan structures

Passing score: 80%

## Consultant Competence Standard

A consultant completing this competency should be able to:

- [ ] Calculate and explain yield to any client
- [ ] Justify property recommendations with Investment Score data
- [ ] Compare properties objectively using the comparison matrix
- [ ] Match any client profile to appropriate properties using Risk-Reward Matrix
