## What You'll Learn

This competency prepares you to pass the Dubai Real Estate Institute (DREI) broker licensing exam. The RERA exam is mandatory for all real estate professionals operating in Dubai, and passing it is your gateway to legal practice in the market.

The exam covers four core areas: broker duties and ethics, regulatory framework, licensing requirements, and landlord-tenant law. This competency distills the essential knowledge into exam-ready modules with critical numbers, common traps, and practice questions.

## Why This Matters

Without a RERA broker card, you cannot legally facilitate property transactions in Dubai. The exam has a 75% pass mark, and many candidates fail on their first attempt due to tricky questions about specific numbers, timelines, and regulatory details.

Mastering this content isn't just about passing an exam—it's about understanding the legal framework that protects your clients and your professional reputation. When you know the regulations deeply, you can advise clients with confidence and avoid costly compliance mistakes.

## Key Outcomes

By completing this competency, you will be able to:

- Pass the RERA broker exam on your first attempt
- Recall critical numbers (fees, timelines, fines) that appear in exam questions
- Identify common exam traps and avoid frequently-missed questions
- Explain broker duties, ethics, and compliance requirements to clients
- Navigate landlord-tenant disputes and eviction procedures

## Prerequisites

Complete Competency 5 (Transaction Management) before starting this module. Understanding the transaction process provides essential context for the regulatory and legal content covered here.

## How This Connects

This competency builds on the regulatory knowledge introduced in Market Intelligence (Competency 1) and the transaction processes from Transaction Management (Competency 5). It prepares you for independent practice and provides the legal foundation for all client advisory work.
