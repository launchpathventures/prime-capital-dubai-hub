**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of handling a commission objection. An investor has been evaluating properties and now asks: "I've spoken with other agents who charge less. Can you match their rate?"

**WEAK DEMO**

*Consultant appears uncomfortable:*

"Well... we try to be competitive. What rate did they offer you?

Look, we can probably work something out. Our standard is 2%, but for the right client, we have some flexibility. If you're serious about moving forward, I can speak to my manager about a discount.

I don't want you to go elsewhere over the commission. We've already put in a lot of work showing you properties. It would be a shame to lose the deal over half a percent.

What do you need the rate to be for us to move forward?"

*End of weak demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT WENT WRONG**

First, they immediately signalled willingness to negotiate without understanding the value question. This positions commission as arbitrary rather than earned.

Second, they appealed to sunk cost—"we've already put in a lot of work"—which sounds like guilt, not value.

Third, they deferred to the manager, which reduces their authority and credibility.

Fourth, they asked "what do you need the rate to be?"—letting the investor set terms rather than explaining value.

**STRONG DEMO**

*Consultant remains calm and direct.*

"I appreciate you being direct about this.

I won't match lower rates, and here's why.

Our commission reflects a specific level of service—market research, due diligence, transaction support through to handover, post-completion assistance. Reducing the rate would mean reducing the service, and that's not what we offer.

For off-plan purchases, the commission is paid by the developer. Your price is fixed regardless of our commission structure—the developer isn't going to reduce your price if we take less. So you wouldn't save anything.

For secondary purchases, our 2% fee is market standard. Some agents charge less. Some charge more. The question is what you're receiving for that fee.

Let me ask you—what did the other agents offer in terms of service? Were they supporting you through handover? What happens if issues arise after the sale closes?

If they're offering a service level that meets your needs at a lower price, that might be the right choice for you. I'd just encourage you to understand exactly what's included before committing.

I compete on value delivered, not on rate. What would help you make this decision?"

*End of strong demo.*

**COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT MADE IT WORK**

First, they didn't engage in rate competition. "I won't match lower rates" is clear and confident.

Second, they explained the reasoning—service level tied to commission. Lower rate would mean lower service.

Third, they clarified the off-plan reality—developer pays commission, buyer's price is fixed. No savings from a lower commission.

Fourth, they asked about the competing offer. What service is included? This prompts the investor to evaluate properly.

Fifth, they respected the investor's autonomy. "That might be the right choice for you" shows confidence without desperation.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version treated commission as negotiable and seemed desperate to retain the client at any cost. The strong version held position with clear reasoning, explained the value exchange, and trusted the investor to make an informed choice. One competes on price. The other competes on value.
