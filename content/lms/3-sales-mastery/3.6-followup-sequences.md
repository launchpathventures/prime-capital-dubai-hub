# Follow-Up Sequences

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **implement systematic follow-up sequences** that maintain momentum with prospects without appearing desperate or pushy—using varied channels, appropriate timing, and value-adding touchpoints.

---

## Why Follow-Up Discipline Matters

Most deals aren't lost at first contact or in the presentation. They're lost in the gaps—the time between conversations when competitors reach out, life intervenes, and interest fades.

**The data:**
- 80% of sales require 5+ follow-up contacts
- 44% of salespeople give up after one follow-up
- The "best time to call" is whenever they're thinking about you

Effective follow-up isn't about persistence for its own sake. It's about staying relevant, providing value, and being present when the client is ready to act.

## The Prime Capital Follow-Up Philosophy

### What We Don't Do

❌ Generic check-ins: "Just touching base to see if you've made a decision"

❌ Pressure messaging: "The units are selling fast—don't miss out!"

❌ Frequency without value: Multiple messages saying the same thing

❌ Passive aggressive: "I haven't heard from you..."

### What We Do

✅ Value-adding touchpoints: Share relevant information, market updates, new options

✅ Varied channels: Mix calls, WhatsApp, email based on client preference

✅ Appropriate timing: Respect their timeline while maintaining presence

✅ Professional persistence: Stay helpful without becoming annoying

---

## The Standard Follow-Up Sequence

This sequence assumes initial contact went well but client didn't immediately proceed. Adapt timing based on their stated timeline.

| Day | Channel | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| 0 | WhatsApp | Immediate summary | "Great speaking with you. Here's my contact info and the project details we discussed..." |
| 1 | WhatsApp | Value-add | Share one piece of relevant information (market article, developer update) |
| 3 | Phone | Check-in call | "Wanted to see if you'd had a chance to review the information and if any questions came up" |
| 5 | WhatsApp | Gentle prompt | "Just following up on our conversation. Happy to answer any questions when you're ready" |
| 7 | Phone | Status call | "Checking in to see where you are in your thinking. Any concerns I can address?" |
| 14 | Email | Formal follow-up | Detailed email with property information, yield projections, next steps |
| 21 | WhatsApp | Value-add | Share relevant market news or new option if available |
| 30 | Phone | Re-engagement | "It's been a few weeks—wanted to see if your circumstances have changed" |

**After Day 30:** Move to monthly touchpoints unless they've indicated clear disinterest.

## Follow-Up Message Templates

### Day 0: The Immediate Summary

Send within 30 minutes of ending the call.

<speak>
Hi [Name], it was great speaking with you about [Project Name]. As promised, here are the key details we discussed:

• Property: [Unit type] at [Project]
• Price: AED [X] with [payment plan]
• Expected yield: [X]%

I've attached the brochure and floor plan. Let me know when you'd like to continue the conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]
Prime Capital Dubai
</speak>

*Why this works: You've summarized what they learned, provided reference materials, and kept the door open without pressure.*

### Day 1: The Value-Add

<speak>
[Name], thought you might find this interesting—[Developer] just released their Q3 delivery update showing 96% on-schedule handovers. Good context for the project we discussed. Let me know if any questions come up.
</speak>

*Why this works: You've provided relevant information without asking for anything. You're being helpful.*

### Day 3: The Check-In Call

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] from Prime Capital. Do you have two minutes? I wanted to check if you'd had a chance to review the information I sent and whether any questions came up.

[If they have questions, address them]

[If no questions:] "Great. I'm here whenever you're ready to continue the conversation. Is there a good time later this week for us to connect, or would you prefer I give you more time?"
</speak>

### Day 7: The Status Call

<speak>
**You:** "Hi [Name], [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I wanted to check in and see where you are in your thinking about [Project Name]. Have you had a chance to discuss with [spouse/partner if mentioned]? Any concerns I can help address?"
</speak>

### The Re-Engagement (After Going Silent)

When a prospect stops responding, acknowledge it directly:

<speak>
[Name], I haven't heard back in a while, and I wanted to check if something has changed on your end. If your circumstances have shifted or your timeline has moved, I completely understand—just let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

If you're still considering Dubai investment but have questions or concerns, I'm happy to help. Either way, I don't want to keep following up if it's not useful.

Best,
[Your Name]
</speak>

*Why this works: You've acknowledged the silence without guilt-tripping. You've given them permission to say no, which paradoxically often re-engages them.*

## Channel Strategy

### When to Use Phone

- Initial contact and early follow-ups
- Complex discussions that need back-and-forth
- When you need to gauge their tone and interest level
- Re-engagement after extended silence

### When to Use WhatsApp

- Quick updates and information sharing
- Sending documents, images, floor plans
- Brief check-ins that don't need a call
- Following up after phone calls with summary

### When to Use Email

- Formal communications and documentation
- Detailed information packages
- When you need a written record
- International clients in different time zones

### Reading Client Preferences

Pay attention to how they communicate with you:

- If they respond quickly to WhatsApp but ignore calls → lean into WhatsApp
- If they prefer scheduled calls → respect that structure
- If they're formal in their responses → match that tone in email

---

## What NOT to Do

### The Pressure Follow-Up

❌ "Hi [Name], just following up. The unit we discussed is getting a lot of interest. I'd hate for you to miss out. Can we talk today?"

*Why it fails: This is transparently pressure. It's not about them—it's about creating urgency.*

### The Guilt Trip

❌ "Hi [Name], I've sent several messages but haven't heard back. I just want to know if I should continue working on this for you."

*Why it fails: This makes them feel guilty rather than valued. It's passive aggressive.*

### The Empty Check-In

❌ "Hi [Name], just touching base. Any updates on your end?"

*Why it fails: There's no value in this message. It's filler.*

### The Premature Close

❌ "Hi [Name], ready to proceed with the booking? Let me know!"

*Why it fails: If they were ready, they would have contacted you. This feels pushy.*

## Following Up with Different Client Types

<details>
<summary><strong>The Slow Decision-Maker</strong></summary>

Some clients take weeks or months to decide. This isn't rejection—it's their process.

**Strategy:**
- Extend your follow-up intervals (weekly → every two weeks → monthly)
- Focus on value-adds rather than check-ins
- Respect their pace while staying present
- Don't interpret slow as disinterested

**Key message:**
<speak>
"I know you're taking your time with this decision, and that's the right approach for an investment this size. I'll keep you updated on anything relevant—new projects, market developments—so you have current information when you're ready. No pressure from my end."
</speak>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Busy Executive</strong></summary>

They're interested but overwhelmed with other priorities.

**Strategy:**
- Keep messages extremely brief
- Respect their time constraints
- Offer to work around their schedule
- Make next steps as easy as possible

**Key message:**
<speak>
"[Name], I know you're busy. Quick question: should I check back next week, or would it help to schedule a specific 15-minute call? I can work around your calendar."
</speak>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Ghost</strong></summary>

They were engaged, then disappeared.

**Strategy:**
- Acknowledge the silence directly (see re-engagement template)
- Give permission to say no
- Offer a graceful exit
- Sometimes silence is the answer—know when to stop

**After 3+ contact attempts with no response:**
<speak>
"[Name], I've tried reaching you a few times without luck. I don't want to keep bothering you if your situation has changed. I'll pause my follow-ups for now, but if you'd like to reconnect in the future, I'm here.

Wishing you all the best either way."
</speak>

## Practice Checkpoint

A client showed strong interest two weeks ago but hasn't responded to your last two messages.

Write out:
1. What your next message would say
2. What channel you'd use
3. What you'd do if they still don't respond

Check: Is your message providing value or just requesting response?

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Following up too frequently**

❌ Daily messages when they asked for a week to think

✅ Match your follow-up pace to their stated timeline

**2. Every follow-up asks for something**

❌ "Let me know when you want to proceed"

✅ Alternate between asking and providing value

**3. Giving up too early**

❌ Two unreturned messages → They're not interested

✅ Some clients need 5+ touchpoints before engaging

**4. Giving up too late**

❌ Following up monthly for 12 months with no response

✅ After 4-5 genuine attempts, shift to passive nurturing (newsletter, market updates) rather than active pursuit

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Day 0-7:** Active follow-up
- Immediate summary (WhatsApp)
- Value-add next day
- Check-in call day 3
- Status call day 7

**Day 7-30:** Spaced follow-up
- Formal email week 2
- Value-add week 3
- Re-engagement call week 4

**After 30 days:** Nurturing mode
- Monthly touchpoints
- Market updates and new opportunities
- No pressure, just presence

**Channel Guidelines:**
- Phone: Initial contact, complex discussions, re-engagement
- WhatsApp: Quick updates, documents, brief check-ins
- Email: Formal communication, documentation, international clients
