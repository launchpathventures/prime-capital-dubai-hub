The space between conversations is where many deals are won or lost. Follow up too aggressively, and you confirm the investor's fear of being pressured. Follow up too passively, and you disappear from consideration.

Strategic follow-up means being present without being pushy—providing value that keeps you relevant while respecting the investor's process. It's harder than it sounds.

You face a tension: investors who are ready to move forward need timely engagement, while investors who need time need space. You can't always tell which is which.

The solution isn't a formula. It's calibration—reading signals, adjusting approach, and being willing to change course when you've misjudged.

In this module, you'll learn the principles of strategic follow-up, appropriate cadence for different stages, and how to maintain relationship quality through prolonged decision cycles. Some investors take years to move forward—the seeds you plant now may yield results in 24 or 36 months.

Let's walk through how to do this well.
