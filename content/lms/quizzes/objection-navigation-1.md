questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What does the 'L' in the LAER framework stand for?"
    options:
      - text: "Learn the objection"
        correct: false
      - text: "Listen completely"
        correct: true
      - text: "Look for signals"
        correct: false
      - text: "Lead the conversation"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The L in LAER stands for Listen completely. Most consultants begin formulating responses before investors finish speaking, missing important information and making the investor feel unheard."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Why should you avoid using the word 'but' after acknowledging an objection?"
    options:
      - text: "It's grammatically incorrect in sales contexts"
        correct: false
      - text: "It makes the sentence too long"
        correct: false
      - text: "It negates everything you said before it"
        correct: true
      - text: "Investors find it unprofessional"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The word 'but' negates everything before it. 'I understand, but...' essentially dismisses the acknowledgment. Pause after acknowledging before providing your response."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "A Dubai-based investor says: 'I've looked at Marina properties before and the developer always delays. I'm not going through that again.' What is the primary purpose of the 'Explore Deeper' step here?"
    options:
      - text: "To find weaknesses in the investor's previous experience"
        correct: false
      - text: "To uncover which specific developer disappointed them and whether this project is different"
        correct: true
      - text: "To gather information for your sales pitch"
        correct: false
      - text: "To buy time before responding"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Exploring deeper reveals the real issue. They've been burned before—you need to know by whom and whether your project has the same risk. The stated concern (delays) masks the real concern (not wanting to repeat a bad experience)."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "Which of the following is the STRONGEST form of evidence when responding to objections?"
    options:
      - text: "Your personal experience with similar investors"
        correct: false
      - text: "Logical reasoning based on market fundamentals"
        correct: false
      - text: "Specific data from authoritative sources (DLD, RERA)"
        correct: true
      - text: "Testimonials from satisfied clients"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Specific data from authoritative sources like DLD, RERA, and bank reports provides the strongest evidence. It's objective, verifiable, and carries institutional credibility."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An Indian investor interested in a Sobha Hartland property asks: 'What's the payment plan? When do I need to pay the DLD fees? Can I get a mortgage for this?' What type of objection is this likely to be?"
    options:
      - text: "Genuine concern about financing"
        correct: false
      - text: "Information gap needing clarification"
        correct: false
      - text: "Negotiation tactic to test your knowledge"
        correct: false
      - text: "Buying signal in disguise"
        correct: true
    explanation: "When objections become more specific and practical—focusing on payment logistics, timelines, and processes—it often indicates serious interest. The investor is mentally preparing to move forward and needs operational details."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What should you do when you feel defensive during a challenging objection?"
    options:
      - text: "Address the investor's tone directly"
        correct: false
      - text: "Pause, breathe, and respond to the content, not the tone"
        correct: true
      - text: "Mirror their energy to show confidence"
        correct: false
      - text: "Redirect to a different topic"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When defensive, pause before responding, take a breath, and remember the objection is about them, not you. Respond to the content of their concern, not their tone."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor viewing properties in Business Bay asks: 'What about the traffic? And the construction noise? And are there enough parking spots? And what about...' Which is a sign that you should step back rather than continue addressing objections?"
    options:
      - text: "The investor asks for more details"
        correct: false
      - text: "Multiple objections are cascading rapidly without giving you time to respond"
        correct: true
      - text: "The investor becomes quiet and thoughtful"
        correct: false
      - text: "The objection involves pricing or location"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When multiple objections cascade rapidly without pause, the investor may be overwhelmed or the objections are masking 'no'. Stepping back gives them space: 'I sense there's a lot to consider. Would it help to take some time?'"

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What distinguishes a negotiation tactic objection from a genuine concern?"
    options:
      - text: "Negotiation tactics are always about price"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns are asked with genuine curiosity; tactics often feel rehearsed"
        correct: true
      - text: "Negotiation tactics come from experienced investors only"
        correct: false
      - text: "Genuine concerns never involve commercial terms"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Negotiation tactics often feel rehearsed, focus on commercial terms, and appear at suspicious timing (after significant engagement). Genuine concerns have emotional undertones and are asked with curiosity."
