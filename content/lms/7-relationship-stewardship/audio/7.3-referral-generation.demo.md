Let me show you two versions of asking for a referral. One that damages the relationship and one that strengthens it.

WEAK APPROACH

The consultant has just completed a transaction and is speaking with the client.

Consultant: So that is everything sorted. We are all done. Hey, do you know anyone else who might want to buy property in Dubai? I am always looking for new clients. If you could send some people my way, that would be great. I will give you my business cards — you can hand them out. Or actually, if you just give me some names and numbers, I can call them directly. What do you think?

Client: Um, yeah, I will think about it.

Consultant: Great, just let me know. And if anything comes through, I will definitely make it worth your while. We could work something out.

COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT WENT WRONG

There are several problems with this approach. First, the timing and transition were abrupt. The consultant jumped straight from closing paperwork to asking for referrals with no acknowledgment of the client's experience. Second, the request was self-centred. Phrases like "I am always looking for new clients" and "send some people my way" make it about the consultant's needs, not the value for potential referrals. Third, asking for names and numbers directly puts the client in an awkward position. They do not want to share their contacts' information without permission. Fourth, mentioning "making it worth your while" introduces a transactional element that cheapens the relationship. Good referrals come from genuine appreciation, not incentive offers.

STRONG APPROACH

Same scenario. The consultant has just completed a transaction and is speaking with the client.

Consultant: I am really pleased with how this came together for you. How are you feeling about it?

Client: Really good, actually. The whole process was much smoother than I expected.

Consultant: That is great to hear. I take pride in making this as straightforward as possible, so I am glad that came through. You know, I am always looking to work with people similar to you — investors who approach Dubai thoughtfully and value having a trusted advisor. If you ever find yourself in conversation with someone considering Dubai property, I would genuinely appreciate an introduction. No pressure at all. But if someone comes to mind, I would be happy to have an initial conversation and extend the same level of care to them.

Client: Actually, my business partner has been asking about Dubai. I could introduce you.

Consultant: That sounds like someone I would enjoy speaking with. Would it be helpful if I sent you a short note you could forward? That way you do not have to explain everything — you can just make the introduction and I will take it from there.

Client: That would be perfect.

COACH ANALYSIS — WHAT MADE THIS WORK

Notice the difference. First, the consultant started by checking in on the client's satisfaction. This confirms positive sentiment before making any request. Second, the compliment was genuine. Saying "people similar to you" and "investors who approach Dubai thoughtfully" positions the client positively and makes the request feel selective rather than desperate. Third, the request focused on value for the referral. The consultant offered to "extend the same level of care" rather than emphasising their own need for business. Fourth, when the client mentioned someone specific, the consultant made it easy by offering to draft a forward-ready email. This removes friction and respects the client's time.

KEY DIFFERENCE

The single biggest change between these approaches is the frame. The weak approach says "I need clients, help me." The strong approach says "I want to serve people like you — if you know someone who would benefit, I am here." One is about taking. The other is about giving. That shift changes everything.
