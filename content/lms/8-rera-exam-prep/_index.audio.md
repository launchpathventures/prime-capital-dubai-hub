# Welcome to RERA Exam Preparation

Welcome to RERA Exam Preparation. This competency has one goal: help you pass the RERA broker licensing exam on your first attempt.

I'll be direct — this is different from the other competencies. The previous eight were about building skills and understanding. This one is about passing a test.

That doesn't mean it's not important. Until you pass this exam, you can't legally operate as a real estate broker in Dubai. It's a regulatory requirement, and we're going to make sure you're ready.

## What Is the RERA Exam?

RERA — the Real Estate Regulatory Agency — requires all real estate brokers in Dubai to pass a licensing examination. This test covers:

- Dubai Land Department regulations
- Real estate law and ownership types
- Transaction processes and documentation
- Agent responsibilities and ethical obligations
- Tenancy law and Ejari requirements
- Off-plan regulations and escrow requirements

The exam is multiple-choice. You need 75% to pass. It's not designed to trick you, but it does require solid knowledge of the regulatory framework.

## What You'll Master

Eight modules that cover the exam content:

**DLD & Regulatory Structure** — Understanding the institutions that govern Dubai real estate: DLD, RERA, and their roles.

**Property Ownership Types** — Freehold, leasehold, usufruct. Who can own what and where.

**Real Estate Law Foundations** — The legal framework underlying all transactions.

**Transaction Documentation** — Form F, Form A, MOU, SPA — what each document does and when it's required.

**Agent Obligations** — Your legal responsibilities to clients, developers, and regulators.

**Off-Plan Regulations** — Escrow law, project registration, buyer protections.

**Tenancy Law** — Ejari, rent caps, eviction rules, security deposits.

**Exam Strategy** — How the test works and how to approach it.

## Good News: You're Already Prepared

Here's something encouraging: if you've completed the previous competencies, you already know most of this material.

Transaction Management covered processes and documentation. Market Intelligence explained regulatory structure. Foundations addressed compliance requirements.

This competency organizes that knowledge specifically for the exam format. You'll review familiar concepts through a regulatory lens, fill any gaps, and practice with exam-style questions.

---

## How to Approach This

Work through each module systematically. Take the practice quizzes seriously — they mirror the actual exam format.

Pay special attention to:
- **Specific numbers** — fees, percentages, thresholds, timelines
- **Legal terms** — know the precise definitions
- **Procedures** — understand the correct sequence of steps

The exam tests recognition, not recall. You don't need to memorize entire passages — you need to recognize correct answers when you see them.

Review your weak areas. Take practice exams until you're consistently scoring above 80%.

## Timeline

Most consultants need about two weeks of focused preparation after completing the training program. Don't rush it, but don't delay either — you want to take the exam while the material is fresh.

When you're ready, schedule your exam through the DLD training center. Your training coordinator can help with the logistics.

Let's get you licensed. Let's begin.
