End-users aren't buying a property—they're buying a home. Their decisions blend practical requirements with emotion, family needs with personal dreams. Most agents treat them like investors, throwing numbers at people who want to understand how it feels to wake up in that space.

Here's what you need to know.

End-user discovery starts with story, not specifications. Ask about what prompted the search, not what size apartment they want. The why reveals everything the what conceals.

Family composition drives requirements. Kids mean schools, which often determine location before anything else. Elderly parents mean accessibility. Pets mean community rules. Understand the household.

Lifestyle priorities shape location. Do they need beach access? Walkable dining? Quiet residential streets? Their ideal week tells you more than their budget does.

Timeline varies dramatically. Some have a start date in three months. Others are exploring for eventual retirement. The urgency level determines your pace.

Remember: end-users buy emotionally and justify rationally. Your discovery must address both dimensions. Make them feel understood first, then you've earned the right to discuss specifics.
