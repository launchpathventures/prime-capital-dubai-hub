Let me show you two approaches to investor discovery. Same scenario—a Singapore-based entrepreneur exploring Dubai allocation after a recent business exit. Same questions to answer, completely different execution.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

Agent: "Hi Michael, thanks for your interest in Dubai property. So you're looking to invest?"

Michael: "Yes, I've been hearing about Dubai yields from some contacts."

Agent: "Great! Dubai has amazing yields—we're seeing six to eight percent in good areas. What budget are you working with?"

Michael: "I'm flexible. Maybe one to two million dollars."

Agent: "Perfect. For that budget I can show you some great options in Marina and JVC. Marina has beautiful waterfront units, JVC is more affordable with higher yields. Do you prefer location or yield?"

Michael: "Tell me more about the yields."

Agent: "JVC you can get seven to eight percent, Marina is more like five to six. But Marina has better capital appreciation potential."

Michael: "How does that compare to other markets?"

Agent: "Much better than Singapore or London. Dubai is really the best market for yields right now. When are you thinking of purchasing?"

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Let's unpack what went wrong.

First, led with generic pitch. "Amazing yields" and "six to eight percent" are marketing claims, not consultation. No attempt to understand what yields Michael is currently achieving or what would make Dubai compelling for him specifically.

Second, jumped to properties immediately. Two sentences in and we're discussing Marina versus JVC. We know nothing about his investment thesis, time horizon, or portfolio context.

Third, accepted "flexible" budget. One to two million dollars is a huge range. No clarification, no understanding of whether this is liquid capital, contingent on other transactions, or just a rough number.

Fourth, competitive positioning was lazy. "Better than Singapore or London" without understanding what Michael knows about those markets, or whether he has holdings there.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

Agent: "Michael, thank you for making time today. Before I share any thoughts on opportunities, I'd like to understand your investment objectives and how Dubai fits into your broader strategy. Would that work for you?"

Michael: "Yes, that makes sense. I've been hearing about Dubai yields from some contacts and want to understand if it's worth a look."

Agent: "What's prompting your interest at this stage? You mentioned hearing about yields—what specifically caught your attention?"

Michael: "Mainly the yield numbers. I'm getting two to three percent in Singapore, similar in Sydney. The six to seven percent I'm hearing about Dubai sounds attractive, but I'm skeptical."

Agent: "That skepticism is healthy. You're right that headline yields can reach six to seven percent, sometimes higher in certain areas, but there's nuance. What gross yield would genuinely make this compelling for you, given your existing portfolio?"

Michael: "If I could reliably get five percent plus net, after all costs, that would be interesting."

Agent: "That's achievable in certain segments. When you think about this investment, is yield the primary objective, or are you also thinking about capital appreciation?"

Michael: "Yield is primary. I have growth exposure elsewhere. This would be income-generating."

Agent: "Understood. What investment horizon are you thinking about? Is this capital you're comfortable holding for five-plus years, or do you need more liquidity?"

Michael: "I'd want liquidity within five years if needed, but I'm not planning to exit quickly."

Agent: "Good to know. You mentioned Singapore and Sydney holdings—how do you think about geographic diversification? Is the UAE exposure attractive or does it add concentration risk?"

Michael: "Diversification is part of the appeal. Different currency, different economic drivers."

Agent: "The AED's dollar peg is relevant there. Let me ask about the capital—is this coming from the business exit you mentioned, or existing liquid holdings? Just want to understand if there are timing considerations."

Michael: "Exit proceeds. Already liquid, no timing constraints."

Agent: "That gives us flexibility. Last question before I share thoughts—what concerns, if any, do you have about investing in Dubai real estate? Better to address those upfront than have them surface later."

Michael: "Honestly, market timing. Dubai seems to have had a big run. Am I buying at the top?"

Agent: "Fair concern, and I won't pretend I can predict cycles. What I can do is show you the data on current valuations versus historical trends, and help you think about entry points that make sense regardless of short-term movement. Want me to prepare that analysis alongside property options?"

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Why did that work?

First, established strategic framing immediately. "Investment objectives" and "broader strategy" signal this isn't a transaction—it's portfolio consultation.

Second, explored yield expectations specifically. Didn't accept "six to seven percent interest"—asked what would genuinely be compelling. Five percent net became the real target.

Third, understood portfolio context. Singapore, Sydney holdings. Diversification motive. Dollar-peg currency attraction. This shapes recommendations.

Fourth, surfaced concerns proactively. Market timing worry was identified and addressed with data-driven approach, building trust.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version pitched. The strong version consulted.

Sophisticated investors can smell a sales approach instantly. They're evaluating whether you can think at their level. Investor discovery isn't about getting to properties quickly—it's about demonstrating that you understand investment, not just real estate.
