# Golden Visa & Residency

## Introduction

The UAE Golden Visa program transforms property purchases into lifestyle and mobility assets. For international investors, residency rights often add as much value as the property itself. Understanding the program thoroughly—and communicating it effectively—is essential.

## Golden Visa Overview

### What Is the Golden Visa?

The Golden Visa is a long-term residency visa (10 years) that allows non-UAE nationals to live, work, and study in the UAE without requiring a national sponsor.

**Key Benefits**:
- 10-year renewable residency
- No sponsor requirement
- 100% business ownership in mainland
- Multiple entries without restriction
- Family sponsorship included
- No minimum stay requirement
- Available for property investors meeting threshold

### Property Investment Route

**Threshold**: AED 2 million property value

**Requirements**:
- Property purchase value of AED 2 million or more **at the time of purchase**
- Both ready and off-plan properties qualify (eligibility is based on purchase price, not completion status)
- Must be owned fully (no mortgage) OR mortgage value must not exceed 50% of property value
- Property must be residential

**Important Clarification**: Golden Visa eligibility is based on property purchase value at time of purchase (minimum AED 2M), not completion status. Both ready and off-plan properties qualify. RERA valuation confirms eligibility for ready properties.

**Official Reference**: [DLD Golden Visa Portal](https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/eservices/request-for-golden-visa-investor/#/)

## Eligibility Details

### Property Value Calculation

| Scenario | Golden Visa Eligible? |
|----------|----------------------|
| AED 2.5M property, no mortgage | ✅ Yes |
| AED 2.5M property, AED 1M mortgage | ✅ Yes (equity > AED 2M) |
| AED 2M property, AED 500K mortgage | ✅ Yes (equity = AED 1.5M + property value > AED 2M) |
| AED 1.8M property | ❌ No (below threshold) |
| Off-plan property AED 3M | ✅ Yes (based on purchase value at time of purchase) |
| Multiple properties totaling AED 2M+ | ✅ Yes (can combine) |

### Joint Ownership

- **Married couples**: Joint ownership eligible—both can obtain Golden Visa
- **Unmarried partners**: Generally, single ownership with one visa holder
- **Multiple investors**: Each investor needs to meet threshold individually

### Off-Plan Eligibility

Off-plan properties **do qualify** for Golden Visa based on purchase value at time of purchase. The DLD website confirms eligibility requires "property the purchase value of which is equal to or more than 2 million AED **at the time of purchase**"—this means off-plan qualifies.

**Key Points**:
- Eligibility is based on purchase price, not completion status
- Both ready and off-plan properties qualify if meeting AED 2M threshold
- For off-plan, the purchase agreement value determines eligibility
- No need to wait for handover or title deed for Golden Visa eligibility

**Note**: Processing timeline may vary. Check with immigration authorities for current processing requirements for off-plan purchases.

## Application Process

### Step-by-Step Process

  - Sons up to age 25 (extended from 18)
  - Daughters (unmarried, any age)
  - Special needs dependents (any age)
- **Parents**: Under certain conditions

- Live in UAE
- Study at any institution

- Travel freely

- Domestic workers (maids, drivers)
- Up to 3 domestic staff typically permitted

## Benefits Deep-Dive

### Business Benefits

**100% Ownership**: Golden Visa holders can own businesses in mainland UAE without local partner or free zone restriction.

**Professional Practice**: Licensed professionals can practice independently.

**Banking Access**: Full access to UAE banking services, investment accounts.

### Lifestyle Benefits

**No Minimum Stay**: Unlike some residency programs, no requirement to spend specific days in UAE.

**Education Access**: Children can attend any school in UAE (public or private).

**Healthcare Access**: Full access to UAE healthcare system with insurance.

### Tax Considerations

**Important**: Golden Visa provides *residency*, not automatic *tax residency*. Tax status depends on:
- Time spent in UAE
- Ties to home country
- Tax treaties
- Individual circumstances

**Recommendation**: Clients should consult tax professionals regarding their specific situation. Prime Capital provides connections but not tax advice.

## Coach Walkthrough: Golden Visa Conversations

### Scenario 1: Explaining the Program

**Context**: Client asks about Golden Visa while discussing property purchase

**Approach**:
1. Confirm their interest level
2. Explain threshold and requirements clearly
3. Connect to their specific situation
4. Clarify what it does and doesn't include

**Example Script**:

> "The Golden Visa is one of the most valuable aspects of Dubai property investment for international buyers. Here's how it works:
>
> If you purchase property worth AED 2 million or more, you're eligible for a 10-year renewable residency visa. This lets you live, work, and do business in the UAE without needing a local sponsor.
>
> The great news is that both ready and off-plan properties qualify—eligibility is based on your purchase value at the time of purchase, not completion status. If you have a mortgage, you need at least 50% equity.
>
> The visa extends to your family too—spouse and children can be included on the same application.
>
> Is residency something you're specifically interested in, or are you mainly focused on the investment itself? That helps me understand which properties might make the most sense for you."

### Scenario 2: Addressing Common Questions About Off-Plan

**Context**: Client asks whether off-plan properties qualify for Golden Visa

**Approach**:
1. Confirm that off-plan does qualify
2. Explain the eligibility basis (purchase value at time of purchase)
3. Clarify any processing timeline considerations
4. Connect to their specific situation

**Example Script**:

> "Great question about off-plan and Golden Visa—there's been some outdated information circulating.
>
> The good news is that off-plan properties absolutely qualify for Golden Visa. The DLD website is clear: eligibility is based on 'purchase value at time of purchase'—meaning when you sign your SPA for AED 2 million or more, you meet the threshold.
>
> Both ready and off-plan properties qualify, so you can choose based on your investment goals rather than visa considerations.
>
> What's most important to you—getting into a specific project or area, maximizing payment plan flexibility, or something else? That'll help us find the right property."

### Scenario 3: Positioning Residency Value

**Context**: Client is comparing Dubai to other markets and weighing value

**Approach**:
1. Quantify the residency benefit
2. Compare to other programs
3. Connect to their specific needs
4. Avoid overselling

**Example Script**:

> "When comparing Dubai to other markets, the residency component is worth factoring in.
>
> A 10-year visa that allows you to live, work, and do business here—plus sponsor your family—has real value. Some clients have told me they'd pay $200,000+ just for that access if it were sold separately.
>
> Compare that to Portugal's Golden Visa, which has become much more restrictive, or programs requiring significantly higher minimums.
>
> Of course, this only matters if residency is useful to you. If you're purely focused on financial returns and wouldn't use the UAE as a base, then it's a nice extra rather than a driver. What role does having a Dubai presence play in your thinking?"

## Common Questions and Answers

### "Can I get Golden Visa with off-plan property?"

**Answer**: Yes, off-plan properties qualify for Golden Visa. The DLD confirms eligibility is based on "property purchase value at time of purchase"—meaning both ready and off-plan properties qualify if they meet the AED 2M threshold. You don't need to wait for completion.

### "What if my property value drops below AED 2M?"

**Answer**: Eligibility is assessed at application. Once granted, the visa is for 10 years regardless of subsequent market movements. At renewal, current value would be reassessed.

### "Can I work in the UAE on Golden Visa?"

**Answer**: Yes, Golden Visa allows you to work. You would still need appropriate work permits for certain professions, but the visa itself is not employment-restricted.

### "What about taxes—am I tax-free?"

**Answer**: The UAE has no personal income tax, but tax *residency* is separate from *visa residency*. Your tax obligations depend on where you spend time and your home country's rules. I'd recommend consulting a tax professional for your specific situation.

### "Can my parents get Golden Visa too?"

**Answer**: You can sponsor parents on dependent visas, but they don't automatically get Golden Visa. Parent sponsorship has separate requirements and typically shorter visa durations.

### "How long does renewal take?"

**Answer**: Renewal is straightforward if you still own qualifying property. Process takes 2-4 weeks and property value is reassessed at that time.

## Other Residency Options

### Property Owner Visa (Under AED 2M)

For properties below AED 2M threshold:
- 2-year renewable visa available
- Requires property ownership
- Less comprehensive than Golden Visa
- Good option for lower-value investments

### Retirement Visa

For individuals 55+:
- Property investment option: AED 1M property
- Or: AED 1M in savings
- Or: AED 20,000+ monthly income
- 5-year renewable visa

### Investor Visa (Business)

For business investors:
- AED 2M business investment
- 10-year Golden Visa
- Separate from property route

## Key Takeaways

1. **AED 2M threshold**: Property purchase value at time of purchase must meet this for Golden Visa eligibility

2. **Both ready and off-plan qualify**: Eligibility is based on purchase value, not completion status

3. **10-year renewable**: The visa provides genuine long-term residency

4. **Family included**: Spouse and children can be sponsored

5. **Real value-add**: Residency rights significantly enhance property investment value for international buyers

6. **Not tax advice**: Residency and tax residency are different—clients should seek professional tax guidance
