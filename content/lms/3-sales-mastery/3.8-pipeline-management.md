# Pipeline Management

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **manage your sales pipeline with discipline**—knowing which opportunities deserve focus, when to advance or disqualify deals, and how to maintain a healthy mix of prospects at different stages.

## Why Pipeline Discipline Matters

Your pipeline is your business. It determines your income next month, next quarter, and next year. Yet most consultants manage pipelines reactively—responding to whoever contacted them most recently rather than systematically working opportunities.

**The consequences of poor pipeline management:**
- Time spent on unqualified prospects who will never buy
- Hot leads going cold while you chase unlikely deals
- Feast-or-famine income cycles
- Stress from uncertainty about what's closing when

**The benefits of pipeline discipline:**
- Predictable income from forecasted closes
- Time focused on highest-probability opportunities
- Clear view of where to invest effort
- Confidence about the business you're building

## Understanding Pipeline Stages

Every opportunity moves through stages. Your job is to advance them forward—or disqualify them.

### The Prime Capital Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Definition | Actions Required |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Lead** | Initial enquiry received | Qualify within 24 hours |
| **Qualified** | Budget, timeline, authority confirmed | Needs analysis, property matching |
| **Presenting** | Actively showing properties | Present options, handle objections |
| **Proposing** | Discussing specific property/terms | EOI discussion, negotiate terms |
| **EOI Submitted** | EOI paid, unit selection pending | Process management, communication |
| **Under Contract** | SPA signed, proceeding to completion | Transaction coordination |
| **Closed Won** | Deal completed | Handover, referral request |
| **Closed Lost** | Deal fell through | Reason logged, nurture plan |

### Stage Velocity

Not all stages should take the same time. Healthy velocity looks like:

| Stage | Target Timeframe | If Exceeds |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| Lead → Qualified | 1-2 days | Needs immediate attention or disqualification |
| Qualified → Presenting | 3-7 days | May need more discovery or isn't priority for them |
| Presenting → Proposing | 7-14 days | May need help narrowing options |
| Proposing → EOI | 7-14 days | May have unaddressed concerns |
| EOI → Contract | 7-14 days | Developer processing (mostly outside your control) |
| Contract → Close | Varies | Dependent on handover timeline |

**If a deal stalls at any stage for more than double the target timeframe, take action: re-engage, disqualify, or identify the blocker.**

## Pipeline Math: The Numbers You Need

### Conversion Rates to Track

| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Lead → Qualified | 30-40% | Quality of lead sources |
| Qualified → Presenting | 60-70% | Discovery effectiveness |
| Presenting → Proposing | 40-50% | Matching and presentation quality |
| Proposing → Close | 50-60% | Closing effectiveness |
| **Overall: Lead → Close** | 6-10% | Full funnel health |

### Working Backwards from Goals

If you need to close 3 deals per month:

- At 7% conversion: You need ~43 new leads/month
- At 50% proposing→close: You need 6 proposals/month
- At 45% presenting→proposing: You need ~13 presentations/month
- At 65% qualified→presenting: You need ~20 qualified leads/month
- At 35% lead→qualified: You need ~57 new leads/month

**Know your numbers.** If you're consistently falling short at any stage, that's where your skill development should focus.

## The Weekly Pipeline Review

Every week, spend 30 minutes reviewing your entire pipeline. Ask these questions for each opportunity:

### Advancement Questions

1. **What's the next step?** If you can't answer this, you're not in control of the deal.
2. **When will it happen?** If there's no timeline, it's not a real next step.
3. **What could prevent advancement?** If you don't know the risks, you can't mitigate them.
4. **Is this deal moving at appropriate velocity?** If it's stalled, why?

### Disqualification Questions

1. **Does this prospect have budget, authority, need, and timeline?** If any is missing, can it be established?
2. **Have they been responsive to follow-up?** Consistent non-response suggests low priority or disinterest.
3. **Is their timeline realistic for our business?** A "maybe next year" isn't a current pipeline deal.
4. **Would I bet on this deal closing?** Trust your gut. If no, why is it in your pipeline?

---

## Prioritizing Your Time

Not all deals deserve equal attention. Use this framework:

### The Priority Matrix

| | High Probability | Low Probability |
|---|------------------|-----------------|
| **High Value** | Priority 1: Active pursuit | Priority 3: Strategic investment |
| **Low Value** | Priority 2: Efficient process | Priority 4: Minimal effort |

**Priority 1 (High probability + High value):** These get your best time and attention. Hot deals, engaged clients, significant commissions.

**Priority 2 (High probability + Lower value):** Process efficiently. Don't over-invest time, but don't neglect them—they're likely to close.

**Priority 3 (Lower probability + High value):** Worth strategic effort to understand what's blocking and whether it can be unblocked.

**Priority 4 (Lower probability + Lower value):** Minimal effort. Automate follow-up, don't invest significant time.

---

## When to Disqualify

Disqualifying isn't failure—it's resource management. Time spent on unqualified leads is time not spent on qualified ones.

### Disqualify When:

- **No budget:** They can't afford what they're looking at and won't adjust expectations
- **No authority:** The decision-maker won't engage and the contact can't advance
- **No timeline:** "Someday" isn't a timeline. If they can't articulate when, they're not buyers
- **No response:** 3+ substantive outreach attempts with no engagement
- **Fundamental mismatch:** What they want doesn't exist in the market

### Don't Disqualify Just Because:

- They're taking time to decide (if they're engaged)
- They have concerns or objections (these can be addressed)
- They went quiet for a week (check in first)
- They're comparing options (normal buyer behavior)

### How to Disqualify Gracefully

Don't ghost—close the loop professionally:

<speak>
"[Name], I've reached out a few times without hearing back. I don't want to keep bothering you if your circumstances have changed. I'll pause my follow-ups for now, but if you'd like to reconnect about Dubai property in the future, I'm here.

All the best."
</speak>

Move them to a nurturing track (occasional market updates) rather than completely deleting—circumstances change.

## Maintaining Pipeline Health

### The Ideal Pipeline Shape

A healthy pipeline is shaped like a funnel—wide at the top, narrowing toward the bottom:

```
LEAD          ████████████████████████████████  (many)
QUALIFIED     ████████████████████            (fewer)
PRESENTING    ████████████████                (even fewer)
PROPOSING     ████████████                    (few)
EOI           ████████                        (very few)
CONTRACT      ████                            (closing soon)
```

### Warning Signs

**Top-heavy:** Lots of leads, few advancing
- Issue: Qualification problems or poor lead quality
- Fix: Improve discovery, tighten qualification criteria, examine lead sources

**Bottom-heavy:** Deals stuck in proposing/EOI
- Issue: Closing effectiveness or deal quality
- Fix: Review closing approach, identify common blockers, ensure deals are truly qualified

**Empty middle:** Leads and contracts, nothing between
- Issue: Not generating new business while servicing existing deals
- Fix: Maintain prospecting even when busy with transactions

**Lumpy:** All deals at same stage
- Issue: Inconsistent prospecting creates feast/famine
- Fix: Systematic lead generation regardless of current pipeline status

## CRM Discipline

Your CRM is only useful if it's accurate. Pipeline reviews become worthless if the data is wrong.

### Daily Habits

- Update every deal after any meaningful interaction
- Log next steps with specific dates
- Add notes that your future self will understand

### Weekly Habits

- Review every active opportunity
- Update probability and close dates based on reality
- Archive or disqualify stalled deals

### Monthly Habits

- Analyze conversion rates by stage
- Review win/loss reasons for closed deals
- Identify patterns that need attention

---

## Practice Checkpoint

Pull up your current pipeline (or imagine one if you're new). For each opportunity, answer:

1. What's the specific next step?
2. When will it happen?
3. What's the probability this deal closes?
4. Should this deal still be in your active pipeline?

If you couldn't answer any of these questions clearly, that deal needs attention.

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Keeping dead deals alive**

❌ "They might come back someday"—keeping every lead forever

✅ Disqualify appropriately. Move to nurture track if appropriate, but don't count them as pipeline.

**2. Ignoring pipeline until desperate**

❌ Only looking at pipeline when you need a deal to close

✅ Weekly reviews, regardless of how busy you are. Prevention beats crisis.

**3. Focusing only on deals about to close**

❌ All attention on proposing/EOI stage, ignoring top of funnel

✅ Balance time across stages. Today's leads are next month's closings.

**4. Overestimating probability**

❌ "They said they're interested, so 80% probability"

✅ Be honest about probability. Interest ≠ commitment. Adjust as evidence accumulates.

## Quick Reference Card

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. What's the next step for this deal?
2. When will it happen?
3. Is this deal moving at appropriate velocity?
4. Should it still be in my pipeline?

**Disqualification Criteria:**
- No budget + won't adjust
- No authority + can't engage decision-maker
- No timeline + not buyers
- No response after 3+ attempts
- Fundamental mismatch

**Pipeline Health Checks:**
- Funnel shaped (wide top, narrow bottom)
- Deals at every stage
- Appropriate velocity (not stalled)
- Accurate probabilities

**Priority Matrix:**
- P1: High probability + High value = Active pursuit
- P2: High probability + Lower value = Efficient process
- P3: Lower probability + High value = Strategic investment
- P4: Lower probability + Lower value = Minimal effort
