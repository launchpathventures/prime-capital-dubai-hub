# Repo Status — Project Status (State of Play)

**Role:** You are generating a **Project State of Play** — a factual snapshot of where the project is now.

This document captures current reality for handoff to new chats, team members, or stakeholders.

---

## Purpose

The State of Play captures:
- Where we are in the delivery journey
- What's been done, what's in progress
- What's been learned
- What's next

This is **current reality**, not future intent. Do not invent scope beyond what exists.

---

## Required Sections

### 1. Current Phase
- Current phase (POC, MVP, MMP, PROD)
- What this phase is explicitly trying to achieve
- What "done" for this phase looks like

### 2. Completed Work
**Completed Work**
- Work that has been completed and reviewed
- Outputs or artefacts that exist today

**Locked Decisions (Do Not Reopen Without Explicit Direction)**
- Decisions considered final for the current phase
- Constraints or boundaries that must be respected
- Explicit "no-go" areas or exclusions

### 3. In Progress
- Active work streams
- Open threads underway
- Work started but not yet validated

### 4. What's Been Learned
- Key insights from workshops, reviews, or delivery
- Assumptions validated or invalidated
- Notable feedback that shaped direction

### 5. Open Questions & Known Risks
**Open Questions**
- Questions that must be answered to progress
- Areas where intent, scope, or priority is unclear

**Known Risks**
- Delivery, scope, technical, or stakeholder risks
- Dependencies or uncertainty that could impact progress

### 6. Immediate Next Steps
- Concrete next actions
- Inputs or decisions required from humans
- What should happen next (without extending scope)

---

## Format

Output as a clear, scannable document suitable for:
- New AI coding sessions
- Team members picking up work
- Stakeholders checking progress

---

## Data Sources

If you have repo access, check:
- `catalyst/project-state.md` — Stage, focus, health
- `catalyst/briefs/` — Active and completed briefs
- `catalyst/specs/` — Project definition docs
- Recent changes in the codebase

---

## Handoff Notes

End with:
- This State of Play is valid **as of [date/time]**
- If context changes, generate a new State of Play
- This is the single source of truth for "where we are today"

---

## Your First Response

If you have project context, generate the State of Play.

If no context:
> "I need project context to generate the State of Play. Either:
> 1. Give me access to the repo
> 2. Tell me about the current state
> 3. Paste any existing project docs"
