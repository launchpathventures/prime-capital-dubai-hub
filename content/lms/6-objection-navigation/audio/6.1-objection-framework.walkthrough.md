**CONTEXT**

The LAER framework is your foundation for handling any objection that comes your way. Whether someone's worried about market timing, questioning developer reputation, or simply stalling, this four-step process gives you a consistent structure to follow. Master this, and you'll never feel caught off-guard by an objection again.

**THE PROCESS**

Let's walk through each step.

**Step one: Listen completely.** Stop talking. Let them finish. Then wait a beat longer. Most consultants start formulating their response before the investor has even finished speaking. This creates two problems—you miss important information, and the investor feels unheard. 

The signals you're listening well: you can repeat back their concern accurately, you notice emotional undertones not just facts, and you pick up on what they didn't say.

**Step two: Acknowledge validity.** Before you respond to the content of an objection, acknowledge its legitimacy. This isn't agreement—it's respect.

Strong acknowledgements sound like: "That's a sensible question. Many investors ask exactly this." Or: "You're right to think carefully about this."

Avoid the word "but"—it negates everything before it. Say "That's a fair concern. Let me share what the data shows." Not "I understand, but..."

**Step three: Explore deeper.** Most objections have an objection behind them. The stated concern is often not the real concern.

When someone says "The market seems overheated," they might actually mean "I'm worried about losing money," or "I don't trust your analysis," or "My partner isn't convinced."

Ask questions like: "What specifically concerns you about that?" Or: "Help me understand what would need to be true for this to work for you."

**Step four: Respond with evidence.** Only after you've listened, acknowledged, and explored should you respond. Lead with evidence rather than opinion. Data from authoritative sources like DLD and RERA is strongest. Your direct experience comes next. Avoid vague reassurances like "Trust me, it'll be fine."

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, interrupting with reassurance. Let them finish completely before you speak.

Second, jumping straight to your counter-argument. Follow the full LAER sequence—shortcuts don't work.

Third, taking objections personally. A raised voice on their end doesn't require one on yours. Respond to the content, not the tone.

**PRO TIP**

When you sense an objection is actually a "no" in disguise—multiple objections appearing one after another, decreasing engagement—give them permission to say no. "Can I ask something directly? If this isn't right for you, I'd rather hear it. No hard feelings." Most people find honesty easier than continuing to dodge.
