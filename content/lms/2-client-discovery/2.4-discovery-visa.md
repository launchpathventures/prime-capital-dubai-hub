# Discovery: Visa-Seekers

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **qualify Golden Visa seekers efficiently** using a discovery script that uncovers their real motivation for residency, family composition, budget constraints, timeline pressures, and understanding of requirements—while correcting common misconceptions.

---

## Why Visa-Seeker Discovery Matters

Visa-seekers think they want a property. What they actually want is what the visa enables: residency, banking access, business formation, family security, or a Plan B.

The property is a means to an end. Your job is to understand the end—then recommend the right means.

Visa-seeker discovery must uncover:
- **Primary motivation:** Why do they want UAE residency?
- **Family composition:** Who will be included on the visa?
- **Understanding level:** Do they know the actual requirements?
- **Budget reality:** Can they actually qualify (AED 2M, paid off)?
- **Timeline pressure:** Is there urgency (visa expiring, business need)?
- **Secondary interests:** Do they also want yield, lifestyle, or appreciation?

Many visa-seekers have misconceptions. Part of discovery is gentle education.

---

## Common Misconceptions to Correct

Before diving into the script, understand what visa-seekers often get wrong:

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "I can use a mortgage" | Property must be fully paid off for visa purposes |
| "Any property works" | Must be residential (not commercial) |
| "AED 2M total" | AED 2M is the minimum; can be multiple properties |
| "Immediate visa" | Process takes 3-6 weeks after title deed |
| "Visa is forever" | 10-year visa, renewable—but must maintain property ownership |
| "I have to live in Dubai" | No minimum stay requirement |

Correct these gently in conversation. Don't lecture; clarify when misconceptions appear.

## The Visa-Seeker Discovery Script

### Opening: Understand Their Starting Point

<speak>
**Consultant:** "You mentioned you're interested in the Golden Visa. Before we look at properties, I'd like to understand what's driving your interest in UAE residency. There are a few different paths to qualify, and I want to make sure we focus on what actually fits your situation. Does that sound okay?"

**Client:** "Sure, I've read about it online but I'm not entirely clear on the details."

**Consultant:** "Perfect—let me help clarify. But first, tell me what's making you consider the Golden Visa right now."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've positioned yourself as helpful, acknowledged they may be unclear, and immediately asked about motivation rather than requirements.*

### Section 1: The Real Motivation

<speak>
**Consultant:** "When you think about having UAE residency, what does that open up for you? Is it about actually living here, having banking access, business opportunities, or something else?"

**Client:** "Honestly, it's a bit of everything. My business deals with the Middle East, and having a presence here would help. Plus, my wife wants somewhere safe if things get unstable at home."

**Consultant:** "So there's a business angle and a security angle. Would you actually relocate to Dubai, or is this more of an option—a Plan B that you maintain?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've uncovered two motivations (business and security) and explored whether it's about living in Dubai or just having the option.*

**Key follow-ups:**
- "If you had the visa tomorrow, what would you actually do with it?"
- "Is banking access in the UAE important for you?"
- "Are there business formation needs driving this?"

### Section 2: Family Composition

<speak>
**Consultant:** "You mentioned your wife. Is she the only family member you'd want included on the visa, or are there children or parents as well?"

**Client:** "We have two kids—twelve and fifteen. They'd be included."

**Consultant:** "Perfect. The Golden Visa covers spouse and children automatically. Would you also want to sponsor parents? That's possible but requires additional applications."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've mapped the full family need and provided useful information.*

**Key follow-ups:**
- "Are the children currently in school? Would they potentially study in the UAE?"
- "Is there a chance family composition changes—more children, elderly parents moving?"
- "Would any family members have their own visa needs, or would they all fall under yours?"

### Section 3: Budget Reality Check

This is critical. Many visa-seekers underestimate the requirement.

<speak>
**Consultant:** "Let's talk about budget. The Golden Visa through property requires AED 2 million minimum, and here's the key part—the property must be fully paid off. No mortgage. Are you looking to invest at the AED 2 million level, or would you be comfortable going higher?"

**Client:** "I was thinking around two million exactly."

**Consultant:** "That works. Now, would this be a cash purchase, or do you currently have funds that would need to come from somewhere—like selling another property?"

**Client:** "Cash. I have the funds available."

**Consultant:** "Perfect. Just to confirm—you won't need a mortgage? Because even if you bought with a mortgage and then paid it off, you'd need to wait until it's clear to apply for the visa."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've confirmed the key requirement (fully paid), verified cash availability, and preempted the mortgage confusion.*

**If they can't afford AED 2M:**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "At AED 1.5 million, the property investment route for Golden Visa won't work—the threshold is two million. However, there are other visa options depending on your situation. There's a retirement visa, entrepreneur visa, and remote work visa. Would you like to explore those, or is the property investment route essential for you?"
</speak>

### Section 4: Timeline and Urgency

<speak>
**Consultant:** "What's driving your timeline? Is there a specific date you need the visa by, or is this more about getting it done when the right opportunity comes?"

**Client:** "My current visa in [country] expires in eight months. I want to have the UAE visa sorted before then."

**Consultant:** "Eight months is comfortable. The property purchase process takes about four to six weeks, then another three to six weeks for the visa application. So you'd want to complete the purchase within the next five months to be safe. Does that timeline work?"
</spend>

*Why this works: You've translated their deadline into an actionable purchase timeline.*

**Key follow-ups:**
- "Is there anything else creating urgency—business decisions, family moves?"
- "Have you already started the process of sourcing funds?"
- "If we found the right property next week, would you be ready to move forward?"

### Section 5: Requirements Clarification

<speak>
**Consultant:** "I want to make sure we're on the same page about the requirements. Let me confirm what you understand about the Golden Visa. What do you know about the process?"

**Client:** "I need to buy a property worth two million dirhams, and then I get a ten-year visa."

**Consultant:** "That's the core of it. Let me add a few details: the property must be residential, not commercial. It must be fully paid off—no mortgage. You can spread it across multiple properties as long as the total reaches two million. And once you have the title deed, you apply for the visa—it doesn't come automatically with the purchase. The visa itself takes about three to six weeks to process. Does that align with what you expected?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've gently educated without lecturing, and you've confirmed their understanding.*

### Section 6: Secondary Interests

<speak>
**Consultant:** "Beyond the visa, what else matters to you about this property? Would you live in it, rent it out, or keep it empty as a holiday base?"

**Client:** "We'd rent it out. We're not moving to Dubai full-time."

**Consultant:** "So rental income matters. That changes what we look for—some properties at the AED 2 million level yield better than others. Would you prioritize higher yield, or would you prefer a premium location even if the return is lower?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've discovered a secondary interest (yield) that shapes property recommendations.*

**Key follow-ups:**
- "If this property appreciated significantly, would you consider selling it—even though that would affect your visa?"
- "How important is the property's quality? Some visa-buyers don't care about the actual asset; others want something they'd be proud to own."
- "Would you ever use this as a holiday home?"

### Closing: Confirm and Educate

<speak>
**Consultant:** "Let me summarize: You're looking for a residential property at or above AED 2 million, paid in cash, primarily to qualify for the Golden Visa for yourself, your wife, and two children. You'd rent it out, so yield matters. Your timeline is completion within five months to beat your current visa expiry. Did I miss anything?"

**Client:** "That covers it."

**Consultant:** "Perfect. I'll put together a few options that hit the visa threshold while also generating decent rental income. I'll include the expected yield for each so you can compare. One more thing—once you purchase, you'll need to open a UAE bank account to receive rental income. That's something we can help coordinate. Shall we schedule a call later this week to review the options?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've confirmed understanding, added practical value (banking), and proposed clear next steps.*

## 🎧 Coach Walkthrough

<speak>
**Coach:** Let me walk you through a visa-seeker discovery that uncovers what's really going on. This client—let's call her Priya—enquired saying "I want a property for Golden Visa." Most agents would immediately show her AED 2M apartments. Let's go deeper.

**Consultant:** "Priya, thanks for reaching out. You mentioned the Golden Visa. Before we look at properties, can you tell me what's driving your interest in UAE residency?"

**Priya:** "My son is starting university at NYU Abu Dhabi next year. I want to be able to visit easily and have a base here."

**Coach:** Interesting. She didn't say she wants to live in Dubai. She wants to visit easily and have a base. And her son is the trigger. Let me explore.

**Consultant:** "So your son's university is the main driver. Would you be coming and going, or would you actually relocate?"

**Priya:** "Coming and going. Maybe a few weeks at a time. My husband's business is in Chennai—he can't relocate."

**Coach:** Now I understand. This is a part-time use case. She wants a property she can stay in when visiting, and the visa gives her easy entry. This changes everything.

**Consultant:** "So you'd use the property when you're here, and it would be empty when you're not? Or would you prefer to rent it out between visits?"

**Priya:** "I hadn't thought about that. Could I rent it short-term?"

**Consultant:** "You could, but there are regulations around short-term rentals. Some buildings don't allow it. We can find options that do, or you could rent long-term and stay in hotels when you visit. What feels better?"

**Priya:** "I'd like to have my own place to stay. Maybe just rent during the periods I'm definitely not coming?"

**Coach:** She wants a home base that also generates some income. This narrows our search—we need something in a building that allows short-term rental, or is in an area where that's feasible.

**Consultant:** "Let's talk budget. The Golden Visa requires AED 2 million minimum, fully paid off. Is that the level you're looking at?"

**Priya:** "Actually, I was thinking more like two and a half. I want something nice that I'd enjoy staying in."

**Coach:** Even better—she has budget flexibility and cares about quality. This isn't a minimum-threshold visa buyer.

**Consultant:** "Two and a half gives you better options. Would that be cash, or..."

**Priya:** "Cash. No mortgage."

**Coach:** Perfect. Now let me check the family angle:

**Consultant:** "Besides yourself, who would be on the visa? Your husband? Other children?"

**Priya:** "Just me and my son. My husband will use his own visa arrangements."

**Coach:** Simpler than I thought. Now the timeline:

**Consultant:** "When does your son start university?"

**Priya:** "September next year. So I want this sorted well before then."

**Consultant:** "We have plenty of time. Let me put together options in the two to two-and-a-half range that work for part-time personal use with rental flexibility. I'll also look at areas close enough to Abu Dhabi that visiting your son is convenient. Does that approach make sense?"

**Priya:** "Yes, that's exactly what I need."

**Coach:** Notice what we learned: She's not a pure investor. She's a mother who wants a home base near her son's university, with visa benefits and some rental income when she's not there. We're not showing her JVC studios. We're showing her quality apartments in areas with good short-term rental potential, preferably with easy access to Abu Dhabi.

That's visa-seeker discovery done right.

## Common Mistakes

**1. Assuming the visa is the only goal**
Many visa-seekers also want yield, appreciation, or personal use. Explore secondary interests—they shape property selection.

**2. Not confirming cash availability**
"I have the budget" doesn't mean they have liquid cash. Confirm they can actually pay without a mortgage.

**3. Overwhelming with requirements**
Don't list every rule and exception. Clarify what they need to know, and address details as they become relevant.

**4. Ignoring the family dimension**
Who's on the visa matters. Parents require separate applications. Children over certain ages have different rules. Map the full family situation.
