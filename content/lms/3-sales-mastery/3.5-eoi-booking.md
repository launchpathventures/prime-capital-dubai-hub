# EOI & Booking Conversion

## Module 3.5 — Skills + Script

The EOI (Expression of Interest) is the pivotal moment in the off-plan sales process. It's where interest becomes commitment. This module teaches you to handle this transition with confidence and integrity.

---

## Understanding the EOI

### What Is an EOI?

An Expression of Interest (EOI) is:
- A reservation payment to hold a specific unit
- Typically AED 20,000 - 50,000 (or a percentage)
- Usually refundable within a defined period
- Not the final commitment — that's the SPA

### Why EOIs Exist

**For the developer:**
- Measures serious interest
- Secures units for genuine buyers
- Filters time-wasters

**For the buyer:**
- Reserves their preferred unit
- Provides time for due diligence
- Low-risk way to secure opportunity

**For you:**
- Converts interest to commitment
- Gives you a concrete next step
- Separates serious buyers from browsers

---

## The EOI Conversation

### When to Introduce the EOI

**Good timing:**
- After thorough needs analysis
- After full presentation
- When buyer shows clear interest
- When asking about next steps

**Poor timing:**
- Before understanding their needs
- During first contact
- When they have unresolved concerns
- When they explicitly say they're "just looking"

### EOI Introduction Script

> "Based on our conversation, it sounds like [Unit X in Development Y] fits what you're looking for. Would you like me to explain how we'd secure this unit for you?"

*Wait for affirmation before proceeding.*

> "Great. Here's how it works:
>
> First, we submit an EOI — an Expression of Interest — for AED [amount]. This reserves the unit for you while you complete your due diligence.
>
> The EOI is fully refundable within [X] days if you decide not to proceed. During that time, you can review the SPA, confirm the payment schedule, and do any additional research you need.
>
> If everything checks out, we convert to a formal booking by signing the SPA and paying the booking deposit.
>
> Does that process make sense?"

## Handling EOI Hesitation

### Common Objections and Responses

**"I need more time to think about it"**

> "Absolutely, it's a significant decision. What specific aspects do you still need to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

*Listen for the real concern, then address it.*

> "The EOI actually gives you that thinking time — it holds the unit while you decide, and it's fully refundable. What I'd hate to see is you make a decision but find the unit you want is no longer available. The EOI protects your option while you finalise your thinking."

**"I want to show my [spouse/partner/advisor] first"**

> "That makes complete sense. Is there any way we could do a quick call together, or I could send you materials to share? 
>
> The challenge we sometimes see is that good units move quickly. The EOI would hold your option while your [spouse/partner/advisor] reviews everything, and it's refundable if they're not comfortable proceeding."

**"What if I change my mind?"**

> "The EOI is designed exactly for that possibility. You have [X] days to complete your due diligence and make a final decision. If anything doesn't feel right during that time, you can withdraw and get your full EOI amount back.
>
> The only risk of placing an EOI is that you decide to proceed. The risk of not placing one is that the unit goes to someone else while you're deciding."

**"I need to see more options first"**

> "I understand wanting to be thorough. Can I ask — what specifically would other options offer that this one doesn't?
>
> [If they identify gaps — address them or acknowledge this may not be the right fit]
>
> [If they can't identify gaps] Based on what you've told me you need, this ticks your boxes. The EOI doesn't commit you — it just holds this option while you confirm there's nothing better out there."

## Creating Appropriate Urgency

### Legitimate Urgency vs. Pressure

**Legitimate urgency (use this):**
- "This unit is one of three left at this price point"
- "Launch pricing ends next week"
- "I have another client viewing this unit tomorrow"

**Pressure tactics (avoid this):**
- "You need to decide today"
- "I can only hold this for one hour"
- "If you don't take it, someone else will" (without being true)

### Urgency Script

> "I want to be transparent with you: this development has sold 70% of units already, and this specific floor plan is popular. I can't guarantee it will be available tomorrow.
>
> That's not me pressuring you — it's just the reality of the market. The EOI protects your position while you decide. Without it, you're relying on availability."

## EOI to Booking: The 48-72 Hour Window

### Why 48-72 Hours Matters

**Momentum:**
- Buyer enthusiasm peaks immediately after EOI
- Delay allows doubts to creep in
- Competing priorities emerge

**Practical:**
- Developers have EOI validity periods
- Other buyers may be interested
- Documentation takes time

### The Booking Process

**Step 1: EOI Submitted**
- Confirm receipt with buyer
- Provide documentation
- Set expectations for next steps

**Step 2: Same Day Follow-up**

> "Hi [First Name], just confirming your EOI for [Unit] at [Development] has been submitted. You should receive confirmation from the developer within [timeframe].
>
> I've attached the SPA for your review. Let's plan a call tomorrow to walk through it together and answer any questions. Does [time] work?"

**Step 3: SPA Review Call (Within 24 hours)**

> "Thanks for making time for this. I want to walk you through the key points of the SPA so there are no surprises:
>
> - Payment schedule: [Review]
> - Completion date: [Review]
> - Your obligations: [Review]
> - Developer obligations: [Review]
> - Exit clauses: [Review]
>
> What questions do you have?"

**Step 4: Booking Completion (Within 48-72 hours)**

> "Based on our SPA review, are you comfortable moving forward with the formal booking?
>
> Here's what happens next:
> 1. Sign the SPA (I can walk you through each section)
> 2. Pay the booking deposit of AED [amount]
> 3. Receive your receipt and signed contract
> 4. Receive payment schedule for construction phase
>
> Shall we proceed?"

## Coach Walkthrough: Conversion Scenarios

<speak>The EOI moment is where most agents either push too hard or don't push enough. Let me show you the balance. The key is positioning the EOI as their protection, not your win. Watch how the language shifts from selling to helping.</speak>

### Practice Scenario 1: EOI Walkthrough

**Situation:** A buyer has just seen your presentation and says, "This looks good, what are the next steps?"

<speak>Perfect buying signal. They're ready but need guidance. Don't launch into forms and payments — frame it first. The psychology: they want to buy, but they're afraid of making a mistake. The EOI structure gives them an escape hatch, which paradoxically makes them more likely to commit.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Agent: "Based on our conversation, it sounds like the 2-bedroom on floor 18 at Creek Harbour fits what you're looking for. Would you like me to explain how we'd secure this unit for you?"

Investor: "Yes, how does that work?"

<speak>Notice the confirmation before the process. I'm not assuming — I'm getting agreement. Now I can explain the EOI with confidence.</speak>

Agent: "Great. The first step is an EOI — Expression of Interest — for AED 30,000. This reserves the unit exclusively for you while you complete your due diligence.

The EOI is fully refundable within 14 days if you decide not to proceed. During that time, you review the Sales Purchase Agreement, confirm the payment schedule, and do any additional research you need.

If everything checks out — and based on your criteria, I'm confident it will — we convert to a formal booking by signing the SPA and paying the 10% booking deposit.

The key benefit: the unit is held for you while you decide. Without the EOI, you're relying on availability, and this floor plan is down to 6 units left. Does that process make sense?"

Investor: "So the 30,000 is refundable if I change my mind?"

<speak>They're calculating risk. Reassure directly on the refund, then reposition the real risk — losing the unit.</speak>

Agent: "Yes, fully refundable within the 14-day review period. The only risk of placing an EOI is that you decide to proceed — which is the outcome you want. The risk of not placing one is that the unit goes to someone else while you're thinking through your decision. For popular developments like this, we've seen units go within 24-48 hours of becoming available."

<speak>See how I reversed the risk framing? The EOI protects them. The real risk is inaction.</speak>

**Your task:** Walk them through the EOI process clearly and ask for the commitment.

**Focus on:**
- Clear explanation of EOI
- Emphasising the refundable nature
- Asking for commitment without pressure

### Practice Scenario 2: Hesitation Handling

**Situation:** After your EOI explanation, the buyer says, "I like it, but I'm not ready to put money down today."

<speak>This is the critical moment. Most agents hear 'no' and back off. Wrong. This isn't a no — it's an unspoken concern. Your job: find the real objection. The surface reason is rarely the real reason.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Agent: "I completely understand — it's a significant decision. Help me understand: what specific aspects do you still need to work through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

<speak>Open-ended question. Let them talk. Whatever they say next is the real objection.</speak>

Investor: "I think I want to see a few more options before I commit."

<speak>Classic objection. The question is: are there real gaps in the property match, or is this decision avoidance? Find out.</speak>

Agent: "That makes sense to be thorough. Can I ask — what would other options offer that this one doesn't? Is there something missing, or do you just want to validate this is the right choice?"

Investor: "I guess I just want to be sure this is the best use of my capital."

<speak>Now we're getting somewhere. This is about confidence, not property features. Reaffirm the investment case, then reposition the EOI as decision-time insurance.</speak>

Agent: "I respect that. Based on everything we've discussed — your yield target of 6%, your timeline, your budget — this unit checks every box. The fundamentals are strong: Emaar's track record, Creek Harbour's location upside, and the 60/40 payment plan that preserves your capital.

The EOI doesn't commit you — it protects your option while you validate your thinking. You have 14 days to review the SPA, run your numbers, even consult an advisor. But it holds this specific unit. If you determine there's something better out there, you get the full AED 30K back. If you confirm this is right — which I believe you will — you've secured it at today's price.

What I'd hate to see is you do that due diligence and come back ready to proceed, only to find this unit has gone to someone else. The EOI prevents that. Does that make sense?"

<speak>Notice the structure: acknowledge concern, reconfirm the fit, reframe the EOI, state the consequence of inaction. Not pressure — consequence. There's a difference.</speak>

**Your task:** Uncover the real objection and address it.

**Focus on:**
- Asking probing questions
- Listening for the real concern
- Providing reassurance
- Repositioning the EOI as risk-free

### Practice Scenario 3: Booking Completion

**Situation:** EOI is in, you've reviewed the SPA, and the buyer is ready. Close the deal.

<speak>This is the home stretch. Your tone should shift from selling to supporting. They've decided. Now you're their guide through paperwork. Confidence and clarity close here — not more selling.</speak>

**Realistic dialogue:**

Agent: "Thanks for reviewing the SPA carefully. Based on our walkthrough yesterday, are you comfortable moving forward with the formal booking?"

Investor: "Yes, I think so. What exactly do I need to do?"

<speak>Final buying signal. Give clear step-by-step instructions. No surprises, no complexity.</speak>

Agent: "Perfect. Here's exactly what happens next:

First, you'll sign the SPA — I can walk you through each section, or if you've reviewed with your legal advisor and you're comfortable, we can sign electronically today.

Second, you'll transfer the booking deposit of AED 280,000. I'll send you the developer's escrow account details. This is a RERA-registered escrow account, so your funds are protected throughout construction.

Third, once payment clears — usually 24-48 hours — you receive your signed contract copy and your payment schedule for the construction phase.

From there, your next payment isn't due for 90 days. I'll send you reminders ahead of each installment.

I'll be here throughout the entire process — SPA questions, payment confirmations, construction updates, all the way to handover. Shall we proceed with the signing?"

Investor: "Yes, let's do it."

<speak>That's the close. Simple, clear, supportive. Now celebrate their decision — this starts the referral relationship.</speak>

Agent: "Excellent choice, [First Name]. I'm genuinely excited for you — this is a strong investment. Welcome to the Prime Capital family. I'll send over the SPA and payment details within the hour."

**Your task:** Guide them through signing and payment.

**Focus on:**
- Confidence in the process
- Clear instructions
- Celebrating the decision
- Setting expectations for what's next
