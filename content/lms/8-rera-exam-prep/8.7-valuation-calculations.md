# Valuation & Calculations

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **accurately answer RERA exam calculation questions** using the three valuation approaches, perform CMA analysis, and calculate DLD fees, service charges, and area conversions.

---

## Why This Matters for the Exam

Calculation questions can make or break your RERA exam score. Unlike memorization questions where you might guess, calculation questions have exact answers. If you know the formulas, these are guaranteed marks.

**Exam frequency:** 12-18 questions involve calculations of some type.

---

## Critical Formulas to Memorize

> ⚠️ **EXAM CRITICAL:** Memorize these formulas exactly.

| Calculation | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| **Area Conversion (sqm → sqft)** | sqm × **10.76** = sqft |
| **Area Conversion (sqft → sqm)** | sqft ÷ **10.76** = sqm |
| **DLD Transfer Fee** | Property Value × **4%** |
| **Mortgage Registration** | Loan Amount × **0.25%** |
| **Service Charge (Balcony)** | Balcony Area × **25%** of standard rate |
| **Gross Yield** | (Annual Rent ÷ Purchase Price) × 100 |
| **Net Yield** | ((Annual Rent - Expenses) ÷ Purchase Price) × 100 |
| **Commission (Standard)** | Sale Price × **2%** |

### Memory Trick: "10.76-4-25"

- **10.76** = sqm to sqft conversion
- **4%** = DLD transfer fee
- **25%** = Balcony service charge rate

## The Three Valuation Approaches

### Overview

RERA recognizes three approaches to property valuation. Each has specific use cases and methodologies.

| Approach | Best For | Key Data |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Sales Comparison** | Standard properties | Recent comparable sales |
| **Income** | Investment properties | Rental income data |
| **Cost** | Unique/new properties | Construction costs |

---

## 1. Sales Comparison Approach (Market Approach)

### When to Use

- Most common approach
- Standard residential properties
- Active market with recent sales

### Methodology

**Step 1:** Identify comparable properties (comparables)
- Same area/community
- Similar size (±10-15%)
- Similar type (apartment, villa, townhouse)
- Recent sales (within 6 months)

**Step 2:** Adjust for differences
- Location premium/discount
- Size adjustment
- Condition adjustment
- View adjustment

**Step 3:** Reconcile to value
- Weight best comparables
- Arrive at value estimate

### Exam Tip: CMA Questions

**Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)** questions focus on:
- Selecting appropriate comparables
- Making adjustments
- Understanding limitations

**Common Question:** "Which property is the BEST comparable?"
- Look for closest match in location, size, and type
- Most recent sale is preferred

### Worked Example

**Subject Property:** 2BR apartment, 1,200 sqft, Marina View

**Comparables:**

| Property | Size | Location | Sale Price | Adj. Price |
|----------|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Comp A | 1,150 sqft | Marina | AED 1,800,000 | +AED 78,000 (size) = AED 1,878,000 |
| Comp B | 1,250 sqft | JLT | AED 1,650,000 | +AED 100,000 (location) = AED 1,750,000 |
| Comp C | 1,200 sqft | Marina | AED 1,850,000 | No adjustment = AED 1,850,000 |

**Reconciliation:** Comp C is most similar → Estimated value: **AED 1,850,000**

---

## 2. Income Approach (Investment Approach)

### When to Use

- Investment properties
- Rental income focus
- Commercial properties

### Key Formulas

**Gross Yield:**
```
Gross Yield = (Annual Rental Income ÷ Property Value) × 100
```

**Net Yield:**
```
Net Yield = ((Annual Rent - Annual Expenses) ÷ Property Value) × 100
```

**Value from Yield (Capitalization):**
```
Property Value = Annual Net Income ÷ Capitalization Rate
```

### Worked Example: Value from Yield

**Given:**
- Annual rental income: AED 120,000
- Annual expenses (service charge, maintenance): AED 15,000
- Market capitalization rate: 7%

**Calculation:**
- Net Operating Income = AED 120,000 - AED 15,000 = AED 105,000
- Property Value = AED 105,000 ÷ 0.07 = **AED 1,500,000**

### Worked Example: Yield Calculation

**Given:**
- Purchase price: AED 2,000,000
- Annual rent: AED 140,000
- Service charge: AED 18,000/year

**Gross Yield:**
- AED 140,000 ÷ AED 2,000,000 × 100 = **7.0%**

**Net Yield:**
- (AED 140,000 - AED 18,000) ÷ AED 2,000,000 × 100
- AED 122,000 ÷ AED 2,000,000 × 100 = **6.1%**

---

## 3. Cost Approach (Replacement Approach)

### When to Use

- Unique properties
- New construction
- Special-purpose buildings
- Insurance valuations

### Formula

```
Value = Land Value + Construction Cost - Depreciation
```

### Components

**Land Value:**
- Valued using sales comparison
- Based on recent land sales
- Location-dependent

**Construction Cost:**
- Current building costs
- Per square foot/meter rates
- Varies by quality level

**Depreciation:**
- Physical deterioration
- Functional obsolescence
- Economic obsolescence

### Exam Tip: Cost Approach

Cost approach is less common in exam questions but may appear as:
- "Which approach is best for valuing a new unique property?"
- "What components are included in the cost approach?"

## DLD Fee Calculations

### Standard Transfer Fee

**Formula:** Property Value × 4%

### Worked Examples

**Example 1: Standard Purchase**

Property Price: AED 2,500,000

| Fee | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Transfer Fee | 2,500,000 × 4% | **AED 100,000** |

**Example 2: Complete DLD Costs**

Property Price: AED 1,800,000
Mortgage: AED 1,440,000

| Fee | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Transfer Fee | 1,800,000 × 4% | AED 72,000 |
| Mortgage Registration | 1,440,000 × 0.25% | AED 3,600 |
| Trustee Fee | > AED 500K | AED 5,000 |
| Admin Fee | Fixed | AED 580 |
| **Total** | | **AED 81,180** |

### Practice Problem 1

## Service Charge Calculations

### Standard Calculation

Service charges are calculated per square foot of built-up area.

**Formula:** Built-up Area (sqft) × Rate per sqft

### Balcony Calculation Rule

> ⚠️ **EXAM CRITICAL:** Balconies are charged at **25%** of the standard rate.

**Formula:** Balcony Area × (Service Charge Rate × 25%)

### Worked Example

**Property Details:**
- Internal area: 1,000 sqft
- Balcony area: 200 sqft
- Service charge rate: AED 18/sqft

**Calculation:**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Internal Area | 1,000 × AED 18 | AED 18,000 |
| Balcony | 200 × (AED 18 × 25%) | AED 900 |
| **Total Annual** | | **AED 18,900** |

### Practice Problem 3

Calculate the annual service charge for:
- Internal area: 1,500 sqft
- Balcony: 150 sqft
- Rate: AED 20/sqft

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Internal | 1,500 × AED 20 | AED 30,000 |
| Balcony | 150 × (AED 20 × 25%) = 150 × AED 5 | AED 750 |
| **Total** | | **AED 30,750** |

</details>

## Area Conversions

### Square Meters to Square Feet

**Formula:** sqm × 10.76 = sqft

### Square Feet to Square Meters

**Formula:** sqft ÷ 10.76 = sqm

### Worked Examples

**Example 1: sqm to sqft**
- Property size: 120 sqm
- In sqft: 120 × 10.76 = **1,291.2 sqft**

**Example 2: sqft to sqm**
- Property size: 1,500 sqft
- In sqm: 1,500 ÷ 10.76 = **139.4 sqm**

### Practice Problem 4

Convert 95 sqm to square feet.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

95 × 10.76 = **1,022.2 sqft**

</details>

### Practice Problem 5

Convert 2,000 sqft to square meters.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

2,000 ÷ 10.76 = **185.9 sqm**

</details>

## Commission Calculations

### Standard Commission Rates

| Transaction Type | Commission |
|-----------------|------------|
| Sale (off-plan/secondary) | 2% of sale price |
| Rental (annual) | 5% of annual rent |

### Commission Split Examples

**Example 1: Single Agent Sale**

Sale Price: AED 3,000,000
Commission (2%): AED 60,000

- If single agent: Full AED 60,000
- If split 50/50: AED 30,000 each

**Example 2: Rental Commission**

Annual Rent: AED 100,000
Commission (5%): AED 5,000

### Practice Problem 6

Calculate the total commission and each agent's share for a AED 4,500,000 sale split 60/40 between listing and selling agent.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Total Commission (2%) | AED 90,000 |
| Listing Agent (60%) | AED 54,000 |
| Selling Agent (40%) | AED 36,000 |
