## Question 1

An investor says "I want a good investment in Dubai." What should you do next?

- [ ] Show them the highest-yielding properties available
- [ ] Ask what they mean by "good"—yield, growth, safety, or something else
- [ ] Send them a list of current opportunities
- [ ] Explain Dubai market fundamentals

**Explanation:** "Good investment" means different things to different people. Without qualifying what they mean—yield-focused, growth-focused, safety-focused, or tax-focused—you can't recommend appropriately. Always dig deeper before assuming.

## Question 2

During investor discovery, you learn the client has spoken to two other agents. What's the best response?

- [ ] Ignore it and focus on your properties
- [ ] Ask what their experience was like and what worked or didn't work
- [ ] Offer to beat any deal the other agents showed them
- [ ] Explain why Prime Capital is better than competitors

**Explanation:** Understanding the competitive situation helps you position effectively. Asking about their experience reveals what they're looking for and what hasn't worked—valuable intelligence for your recommendations.

## Question 3

A client's stated goal is "high rental yield." Using the "Goal Behind the Goal" technique, which question would best uncover their deeper motivation?

- [ ] "What yield percentage are you targeting?"
- [ ] "What does that rental income actually mean for you?"
- [ ] "Have you considered areas with higher yields?"
- [ ] "Would you sacrifice yield for capital growth?"

**Explanation:** "What does that rental income actually mean for you?" uncovers the motivation behind the stated goal. They might reveal it's about early retirement, financial independence, or replacing job income—information that shapes your entire recommendation.

## Question 4

An Indian investor seems interested but keeps giving vague answers. What's the most appropriate approach?

- [ ] Push harder for specific information
- [ ] Assume they're not serious and deprioritize
- [ ] Offer specific options to choose from rather than open-ended questions
- [ ] End the call and follow up by email instead

**Explanation:** Some clients don't respond well to open-ended questions. Offering specific options ("Are you more focused on yield or capital growth?") gives them something to react to and often generates more information than "What are you looking for?"

## Question 5

A Russian investor won't discuss budget. Which approach is most effective?

- [ ] "I need to know your budget to help you."
- [ ] "Dubai has properties from AED 500K to AED 50M. Are we talking entry-level, mid-market, or premium?"
- [ ] "I can't proceed without a specific budget range."
- [ ] Show them a variety of price points and see what resonates.

**Explanation:** Offering range categories (entry-level, mid-market, premium) is less invasive than asking for specific numbers. It gives the client a comfortable way to indicate their level without revealing exact figures they may prefer to keep private.

## Question 6

You've completed discovery with an investor. Before recommending properties, what should you always do?

- [ ] Send them listings immediately while interest is high
- [ ] Summarize what you've understood and confirm accuracy
- [ ] Ask if they want to see properties
- [ ] Check your inventory for matching options

**Explanation:** Always confirm understanding before proceeding. Summarizing what you've heard catches misunderstandings early and shows the client you've listened carefully. It builds trust and prevents wasted time showing wrong properties.

## Question 7

An investor says their financial advisor will need to review any opportunity. What's the strategic implication?

- [ ] The advisor will probably kill the deal
- [ ] Your recommendations need to be data-backed and analytical
- [ ] You should try to bypass the advisor
- [ ] This is a red flag indicating the client isn't serious

**Explanation:** When advisors are involved, they'll scrutinize numbers and details. This means your recommendations need to be data-backed, not sales-driven. Prepare detailed analysis, yield calculations, and risk assessments that will satisfy professional review.

## Question 8

During investor discovery, which piece of information is MOST important to establish early?

- [ ] Their favorite Dubai neighborhoods
- [ ] Whether they're paying cash or financing
- [ ] Their primary investment objective (yield vs growth vs diversification)
- [ ] How many properties they want to buy

**Explanation:** The primary investment objective shapes everything else. A yield-focused investor needs different properties than a growth-focused one. Without knowing this, you're guessing. Budget and financing matter too, but objectives determine the fundamental direction.
