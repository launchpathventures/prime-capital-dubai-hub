### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Property registration questions are your opportunity to pick up guaranteed marks. These are typically straightforward factual questions — if you know the numbers, you get the points.

The number you'll see most often: four percent. That's the DLD transfer fee, calculated on the property value. For a two million dirham property, the transfer fee is eighty thousand dirhams.

Don't confuse this with mortgage registration, which is zero point two five percent of the loan amount — not the property value. That's a common exam trap.

Trustee fees are fixed amounts. Properties valued at five hundred thousand or below: four thousand dirhams. Above five hundred thousand: five thousand dirhams.

Know the difference between DLD and RERA. DLD issues title deeds and handles property registration. RERA regulates brokers and developers. When a question asks who issues title deeds, the answer is always Dubai Land Department, not RERA.

The transfer process follows a sequence: obtain NOC from developer, block the property at DLD, then complete the transfer at a trustee. The exam may ask what happens first or what comes after a specific step.

Dubai REST is DLD's digital platform for Ejari registration, property valuations, and transaction tracking.
