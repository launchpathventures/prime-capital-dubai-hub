Let me show you BANT+ qualification in action. Same prospect—someone who reached out via WhatsApp after seeing an Instagram post, says they're "interested in Dubai investment." Watch how systematic qualification reveals the reality.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

Agent: "Hi David, thanks for reaching out! So you're interested in investing in Dubai. What kind of property are you looking for?"

David: "I'm not sure yet. Maybe something that generates rental income."

Agent: "Great, we have lots of options for that. What's your budget?"

David: "Flexible. Maybe one to two million."

Agent: "Perfect. That's a good range. When are you thinking of purchasing?"

David: "No rush. Just exploring for now."

Agent: "Okay, let me send you some options and we can go from there. What areas interest you?"

David: "I don't really know Dubai well. What would you recommend?"

Agent: "Marina and Downtown are always popular. I'll send some listings there. What's your WhatsApp? I'll share a few properties."

**COACH ANALYSIS**

This agent qualified nothing. Let's count the failures.

Budget was vague and accepted. "Flexible, maybe one to two million"—that's a million-dirham range with no clarity on whether it includes transaction costs, whether funds are liquid, or whether this is real or aspirational.

Authority wasn't explored at all. Is David the sole decision-maker? Does he have a wife, business partner, or family member who needs to approve? We have no idea.

Need was obviously weak. "Just exploring for now"—this is not a qualified prospect. No urgency, no driving force, no timeline.

Timeline confirmed the lack of need. "No rush" combined with "just exploring" means this person is not buying anytime soon.

Capability wasn't touched. Can David travel to Dubai? Transfer funds internationally? We don't know.

The agent is about to spend hours preparing listings for someone who might never buy.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

Agent: "David, thanks for reaching out. I'd love to help you explore Dubai opportunities. Before we dive into specific properties, let me understand your situation so I can point you in the right direction. What budget range are you working with for this investment?"

David: "Oh, I'm flexible. Maybe one to two million."

Agent: "One to two million AED is a good range—gives us options. Just to clarify, is that including transaction costs, or is that your property budget? There's typically about six to seven percent on top for DLD fees and other costs."

David: "Oh, I didn't know about those costs. I guess my total budget is around two million then."

Agent: "No problem, that's helpful to know. So we're looking at properties around one point eight to one point nine million. Next question—are you making this decision independently, or will others be involved? Spouse, business partner, family?"

David: "Well, my wife will need to agree. And actually, my brother and I might do this together as a joint investment."

Agent: "Got it. Have you and your brother discussed this already? What's his interest level?"

David: "We've talked about it casually. He's interested but I haven't sent him anything concrete yet."

Agent: "Makes sense. Would it be helpful to include him in our next conversation, so you're both getting the same information?"

David: "Maybe later. Let me see what's available first."

Agent: "Fair enough. Let me ask about timing—what's prompting your interest in Dubai investment right now?"

David: "Just exploring, really. I've been hearing a lot about Dubai, thought I'd look into it."

Agent: "That's great that you're doing research. On a scale of one to ten, how committed are you to actually making a purchase in the next six to twelve months?"

David: "Hmm, maybe a five or six? If I find the right thing, sure."

Agent: "Understood. And logistics—would you be able to travel to Dubai to view properties, or would you prefer to work remotely?"

David: "I'd probably need to see it first, but I'm pretty busy with work. Maybe in a few months?"

Agent: "Let me be honest with you, David. Based on what you've shared, you're in early research mode—exploring options, timeline is flexible, and you'd need to coordinate with your brother and wife before moving forward. That's totally fine, but it means you're not quite ready for an active property search yet."

David: "Yeah, I guess that's fair."

Agent: "Here's what I'd suggest. I'll send you some market overview materials and a few example properties in your budget range so you can see what's available. Share those with your brother and wife. If everyone's genuinely interested, schedule a call with all three of you and I can answer questions properly. Does that work?"

David: "Yeah, that works."

Agent: "Perfect. Stay in touch, and reach back out when you're all aligned and ready to move forward."

**COACH ANALYSIS**

Let's score this prospect on BANT+.

Budget—yellow flag. Needed education on transaction costs. Real budget is around one point eight million, not two.

Authority—red flag. Wife and brother both involved but neither consulted yet. Multiple stakeholders, none aligned.

Need—red flag. "Just exploring," rated himself five or six out of ten. No driving force.

Timeline—red flag. "No rush," can't visit for "a few months." No external deadline.

Fit—yellow flag. Seems reasonable but hasn't demonstrated commitment to advisory approach.

Capability—yellow flag. Can visit eventually but timing unclear.

Total score: zero green, three yellow, three red. This is not a qualified prospect for active engagement.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The weak version treated an inquiry as a lead. The strong version qualified the inquiry and determined appropriate investment of time.

Both agents will follow up. But the strong agent won't spend hours on unqualified prospects. That time goes to people who are actually ready to buy.
