# EOI & Booking Conversion

## Module 3.5 — Skills + Script

The EOI (Expression of Interest) is the pivotal moment in the off-plan sales process. It's where interest becomes commitment. This module teaches you to handle this transition with confidence and integrity.

---

## Understanding the EOI

### What Is an EOI?

An Expression of Interest (EOI) is:
- A reservation payment to hold a specific unit
- Typically AED 20,000 - 50,000 (or a percentage)
- Usually refundable within a defined period
- Not the final commitment — that's the SPA

### Why EOIs Exist

**For the developer:**
- Measures serious interest
- Secures units for genuine buyers
- Filters time-wasters

**For the buyer:**
- Reserves their preferred unit
- Provides time for due diligence
- Low-risk way to secure opportunity

**For you:**
- Converts interest to commitment
- Gives you a concrete next step
- Separates serious buyers from browsers

---

## The EOI Conversation

### When to Introduce the EOI

**Good timing:**
- After thorough needs analysis
- After full presentation
- When buyer shows clear interest
- When asking about next steps

**Poor timing:**
- Before understanding their needs
- During first contact
- When they have unresolved concerns
- When they explicitly say they're "just looking"

### EOI Introduction Script

> "Based on our conversation, it sounds like [Unit X in Development Y] fits what you're looking for. Would you like me to explain how we'd secure this unit for you?"

*Wait for affirmation before proceeding.*

> "Great. Here's how it works:
>
> First, we submit an EOI — an Expression of Interest — for AED [amount]. This reserves the unit for you while you complete your due diligence.
>
> The EOI is fully refundable within [X] days if you decide not to proceed. During that time, you can review the SPA, confirm the payment schedule, and do any additional research you need.
>
> If everything checks out, we convert to a formal booking by signing the SPA and paying the booking deposit.
>
> Does that process make sense?"

## Handling EOI Hesitation

### Common Objections and Responses

**"I need more time to think about it"**

> "Absolutely, it's a significant decision. What specific aspects do you still need to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

*Listen for the real concern, then address it.*

> "The EOI actually gives you that thinking time — it holds the unit while you decide, and it's fully refundable. What I'd hate to see is you make a decision but find the unit you want is no longer available. The EOI protects your option while you finalise your thinking."

**"I want to show my [spouse/partner/advisor] first"**

> "That makes complete sense. Is there any way we could do a quick call together, or I could send you materials to share? 
>
> The challenge we sometimes see is that good units move quickly. The EOI would hold your option while your [spouse/partner/advisor] reviews everything, and it's refundable if they're not comfortable proceeding."

**"What if I change my mind?"**

> "The EOI is designed exactly for that possibility. You have [X] days to complete your due diligence and make a final decision. If anything doesn't feel right during that time, you can withdraw and get your full EOI amount back.
>
> The only risk of placing an EOI is that you decide to proceed. The risk of not placing one is that the unit goes to someone else while you're deciding."

**"I need to see more options first"**

> "I understand wanting to be thorough. Can I ask — what specifically would other options offer that this one doesn't?
>
> [If they identify gaps — address them or acknowledge this may not be the right fit]
>
> [If they can't identify gaps] Based on what you've told me you need, this ticks your boxes. The EOI doesn't commit you — it just holds this option while you confirm there's nothing better out there."

## Creating Appropriate Urgency

### Legitimate Urgency vs. Pressure

**Legitimate urgency (use this):**
- "This unit is one of three left at this price point"
- "Launch pricing ends next week"
- "I have another client viewing this unit tomorrow"

**Pressure tactics (never use these):**
- "You must decide today or lose it"
- "I can only hold this for one hour"
- "If you don't take it, someone else definitely will" (when uncertain)

### Urgency Script

> "I want to be transparent with you: this development has sold 70% of units already, and this specific floor plan is popular. I can't guarantee it will be available tomorrow.
>
> That's not me pressuring you — it's just the reality of the market. The EOI protects your position while you decide. Without it, you're relying on availability."

## EOI to Booking: The 48-72 Hour Window

### Why 48-72 Hours Matters

**Momentum:**
- Buyer enthusiasm peaks immediately after EOI
- Delay allows doubts to creep in
- Competing priorities emerge

**Practical:**
- Developers have EOI validity periods
- Other buyers may be interested
- Documentation takes time

### The Booking Process

**Step 1: EOI Submitted**
- Confirm receipt with buyer
- Provide documentation
- Set expectations for next steps

**Step 2: Same Day Follow-up**

> "Hi [First Name], just confirming your EOI for [Unit] at [Development] has been submitted. You should receive confirmation from the developer within [timeframe].
>
> I've attached the SPA for your review. Let's plan a call tomorrow to walk through it together and answer any questions. Does [time] work?"

**Step 3: SPA Review Call (Within 24 hours)**

> "Thanks for making time for this. I want to walk you through the key points of the SPA so there are no surprises:
>
> - Payment schedule: [Review]
> - Completion date: [Review]
> - Your obligations: [Review]
> - Developer obligations: [Review]
> - Exit clauses: [Review]
>
> What questions do you have?"

**Step 4: Booking Completion (Within 48-72 hours)**

> "Based on our SPA review, are you comfortable moving forward with the formal booking?
>
> Here's what happens next:
> 1. Sign the SPA (I can walk you through each section)
> 2. Pay the booking deposit of AED [amount]
> 3. Receive your receipt and signed contract
> 4. Receive payment schedule for construction phase
>
> Shall we proceed?"

## Coach Walkthrough: Conversion Scenarios

### Practice Scenario 1: EOI Walkthrough

**Situation:** A buyer has just seen your presentation and says, "This looks good, what are the next steps?"

**Your task:** Walk them through the EOI process clearly and ask for the commitment.

**Focus on:**
- Clear explanation of EOI
- Emphasising the refundable nature
- Asking for commitment without pressure

### Practice Scenario 2: Hesitation Handling

**Situation:** After your EOI explanation, the buyer says, "I like it, but I'm not ready to put money down today."

**Your task:** Uncover the real objection and address it.

**Focus on:**
- Asking probing questions
- Listening for the real concern
- Providing reassurance
- Repositioning the EOI as risk-free

### Practice Scenario 3: Booking Completion

**Situation:** EOI is in, you've reviewed the SPA, and the buyer is ready. Close the deal.

**Your task:** Guide them through signing and payment.

**Focus on:**
- Confidence in the process
- Clear instructions
- Celebrating the decision
- Setting expectations for what's next

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### What NOT to do:

**1. Assuming they'll say yes**
> ❌ "So I'll send over the EOI form now."

*Problem: Doesn't ask for commitment, seems presumptuous.*

**2. Apologising for asking**
> ❌ "I know it's a lot of money, but would you consider..."

*Problem: Undermines the value and your confidence.*

**3. Leaving without a next step**
> ❌ "Let me know what you decide."

*Problem: No commitment, no follow-up trigger.*

**4. Overselling the urgency**
> ❌ "This unit will definitely be gone by tomorrow!"

*Problem: If it isn't, you've lost credibility.*

### What TO do:

**1. Ask confidently**
> ✅ "Would you like me to secure this unit for you?"

**2. Position the EOI as their benefit**
> ✅ "The EOI protects your option while you decide."

**3. Get a concrete next step**
> ✅ "Let's schedule a call tomorrow at 10am to review the SPA."

**4. Be honest about availability**
> ✅ "There are three units left at this price. I can't promise availability, but I won't exaggerate either."
