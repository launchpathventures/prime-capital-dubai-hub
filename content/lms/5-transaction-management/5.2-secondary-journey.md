# Secondary Transaction Journey

## Introduction

Secondary market transactions—resale properties—follow a different process than off-plan purchases. Instead of dealing with a developer, you're coordinating between buyer, seller, their respective agents, and the Dubai Land Department.

This module maps the complete secondary transaction journey and highlights the critical differences from off-plan purchases.

## Off-Plan vs. Secondary: Key Differences

| Aspect | Off-Plan | Secondary |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Seller | Developer | Individual owner |
| Contract | SPA | MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) |
| Registration | Oqood | Form F + Title Transfer |
| Timeline | 1-4 years to handover | 30-60 days to completion |
| NOC | Not required | Required from developer/community |
| Condition | New, unoccupied | Existing, may need inspection |
| Price Negotiation | Limited | Common |

---

## The Secondary Transaction Timeline

### Overview

| Stage | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1. Viewing & Selection | Varies | Property viewings, due diligence |
| 2. Offer & Negotiation | 1-7 days | Price negotiation, terms agreement |
| 3. MOU Signing | 1-3 days | Form F signed, deposit paid |
| 4. NOC Application | 7-21 days | Developer/community clearance |
| 5. Mortgage (if applicable) | 14-30 days | Bank approval and valuation |
| 6. Transfer Booking | 1-7 days | DLD appointment scheduled |
| 7. Title Transfer | 1 day | DLD transfer completed |
| 8. Handover | Same day or shortly after | Keys and access transferred |

**Total Timeline:** Typically 30-60 days from MOU to transfer

---

## Stage 1: Viewing & Selection

### What Happens

- Buyer views properties matching their criteria
- Due diligence on property condition and value
- Market comparisons and pricing analysis
- Decision to make offer

### Your Role (Buyer's Agent)

- **Arrange viewings** — coordinate with seller's agent
- **Assess condition** — note any visible issues
- **Research comparables** — advise on fair market value
- **Verify ownership** — confirm seller has clear title
- **Identify encumbrances** — check for existing mortgages

### Due Diligence Items

- [ ] Title deed verification (seller owns the property)
- [ ] Existing mortgage status
- [ ] Service charge payment status
- [ ] Community restrictions (rental, renovation)
- [ ] Tenant status (if applicable)
- [ ] Property condition assessment

---

## Stage 2: Offer & Negotiation

### What Happens

- Buyer makes offer (verbal or written)
- Seller responds (accept, reject, counter)
- Terms negotiated (price, timeline, conditions)
- Agreement reached in principle

### Your Role

- **Present offer professionally** — in writing preferred
- **Justify offer price** — use market data
- **Negotiate terms** — balance client interests with deal viability
- **Document agreement** — confirm all terms in writing
- **Set expectations** — timeline and next steps

### Offer Components

| Item | Typical Terms |
|------|---------------|
| Offer price | Per negotiation |
| Deposit | 10% of purchase price |
| Completion timeline | 30-60 days from MOU |
| Conditions | Subject to mortgage approval, NOC, etc. |
| Included items | Furniture, fixtures, appliances |

### Negotiation Tips

**For Buyer's Agent:**
- Start with data-backed offer (not lowball without justification)
- Identify seller's motivation (timeline, price, certainty)
- Be prepared to walk away if terms unreasonable

**For Seller's Agent:**
- Understand seller's bottom line before negotiating
- Present offers professionally, regardless of amount
- Qualify buyer's ability to complete before accepting

---

## Stage 3: MOU Signing (Form F)

### What Happens

**Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) / Form F:**
- Legally binding agreement between buyer and seller
- Deposit paid (typically 10%)
- Transaction terms documented
- Timeline for completion established

**Duration:** 1-3 days once terms agreed

### Key Documents

1. **Form F (MOU)** — Standard RERA contract
2. **Passport Copies** — Buyer and seller
3. **Title Deed Copy** — Current ownership proof
4. **Deposit Cheque** — 10% to conveyancing office
5. **Agency Agreement** — Commission terms

### Form F Key Clauses

**Purchase Price:**
- Agreed amount
- Breakdown of payments

**Deposit:**
- Amount held
- Conditions for forfeiture or return

**Completion Date:**
- Target transfer date
- Consequences of delay

**Conditions:**
- Subject to mortgage approval
- Subject to NOC issuance

**Commission:**
- Typically 2% buyer side, 2% seller side
- Who pays what

### Your Role

- **Prepare Form F** accurately with all details
- **Review with client** before signing
- **Coordinate signing** — both parties sign
- **Collect deposit** — ensure cheque deposited correctly
- **Distribute copies** — all parties receive signed MOU

### Deposit Handling

**Critical Rule:**
Deposit cheques should be made payable to the conveyancing office/trustee—never to agents or individuals personally.

**Standard Practice:**
- 10% deposit held in trust
- Released to seller upon transfer completion
- Forfeited to seller if buyer defaults
- Returned to buyer if seller defaults

---

## Stage 4: NOC Application

### What Happens

**No Objection Certificate (NOC):**
- Application to developer/master community
- Confirms all service charges paid
- Confirms no outstanding dues
- Approves transfer to new owner

**Duration:** 7-21 days (highly variable)

**Cost:** AED 500-5,000 (varies by developer/community)

### Your Role

- **Initiate NOC application** — or confirm seller has initiated
- **Track status** — follow up regularly
- **Communicate timeline** — keep all parties informed
- **Address issues** — help resolve outstanding dues

### NOC Requirements

**Typical Requirements:**
- Application form
- Title deed copy
- MOU copy
- Passport copies (buyer and seller)
- Service charge clearance
- Outstanding fees payment (if any)

### Common NOC Delays

- **Outstanding service charges:** Seller must clear before NOC issued
- **Processing backlog:** Some developers slow to process
- **Documentation issues:** Incorrect or incomplete application
- **Mortgage release:** If property has existing mortgage

### Managing NOC Timeline

> "The NOC application has been submitted to [developer]. Typical processing time is [X] days. I'll follow up [twice weekly/as appropriate] and keep you updated on status. If there are any outstanding amounts, we'll address them immediately to avoid delays."

**Duration:** 2-4 hours typically

### Your Role

- **Attend transfer** — support your client

- **Confirm completion** — title deed in buyer's name
- **Collect commission** — per agreement

### Transfer Process Steps

## Common Secondary Transaction Issues

### 1. NOC Delays

**Problem:** Developer slow to process NOC
**Solution:** Follow up persistently, escalate to senior developer contacts, keep all parties informed of status

### 2. Seller's Outstanding Mortgage

**Problem:** Seller's existing mortgage must be cleared before transfer
**Solution:** Coordinate with seller's bank for discharge; buyer's funds may be used to clear (with proper safeguards)

### 3. Buyer's Mortgage Delays

**Problem:** Bank approval takes longer than expected
**Solution:** Start mortgage process immediately after MOU; choose bank with reliable timeline

### 4. Price Renegotiation Attempts

**Problem:** One party tries to change price after MOU
**Solution:** MOU is binding—price cannot change unless both parties agree in writing

### 5. Tenant Issues

**Problem:** Property has existing tenant
**Solution:** Verify tenancy terms before MOU; buyer must honor existing lease

## Key Takeaways

1. **Secondary transactions are faster** — 30-60 days vs. years for off-plan
2. **MOU (Form F) is legally binding** — treat it seriously
3. **NOC is often the critical path** — start immediately after MOU
4. **Coordination is essential** — multiple parties, multiple agents, tight timelines
5. **Due diligence before MOU** — verify title, mortgage status, service charges
6. **Deposit is at risk** — ensure client understands forfeiture conditions
7. **Transfer day requires preparation** — all documents and funds ready
8. **Commission paid at transfer** — typically 2% from each party
