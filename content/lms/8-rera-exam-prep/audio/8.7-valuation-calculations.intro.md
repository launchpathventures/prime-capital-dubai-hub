Calculation questions can make or break your RERA exam score. Unlike knowledge questions where you might make an educated guess, calculations have exact answers. Know the formulas and these become guaranteed marks.

Expect twelve to eighteen questions involving calculations. DLD fees, area conversions, service charges, yield calculations — they all follow specific formulas.

Here are the critical numbers. For area conversion: one square meter equals ten point seven six square feet. Not ten. Not eleven. Ten point seven six. DLD transfer fee is four percent of property value. Mortgage registration is zero point two five percent of the loan amount.

Service charge calculation has a trap: balconies are charged at twenty-five percent of the standard rate, not the full rate.

The three valuation approaches you need to know: Sales Comparison for standard properties in active markets, Income Approach for investment properties focused on rental returns, and Cost Approach for unique or newly constructed properties.

In the walkthrough, we'll work through each calculation type step by step, so you can tackle any number they throw at you with confidence.
