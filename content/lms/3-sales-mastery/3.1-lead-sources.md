# Off-Plan Lead Sources

## Module 3.1 — Knowledge Foundation

Understanding where leads come from shapes how you respond to them. Different sources indicate different intent levels, budget ranges, and urgency.

---

## The Lead Source Hierarchy

Not all leads are equal. Your response strategy should match the source:

### Tier 1: High-Intent Sources (Respond in 60 seconds)

**1. Property Portals (Property Finder, Bayut, Dubizzle)**
- Lead has actively searched for specific criteria
- Usually have defined budget and area preferences
- Ready to have a conversation about options
- **Quality indicator:** Specific enquiry vs. generic "send me info"

**2. Direct Website Enquiries**
- Visitor has researched your firm specifically
- Higher trust baseline — they chose you
- Often come with specific questions
- **Quality indicator:** Detailed enquiry form completion

**3. Referrals from Existing Clients**
- Pre-qualified by someone who trusts you
- Usually have realistic expectations
- Warm introduction accelerates rapport
- **Quality indicator:** Clarity on what they're looking for

### Tier 2: Warm Sources (Respond within 2 hours)

**4. Developer Launch Registrations**
- Expressed interest in specific development
- May have attended presentation or webinar
- Intent confirmed, but may be shopping around
- **Quality indicator:** Event attendance vs. just registration

**5. Social Media Enquiries**
- Varying intent levels — some just curious
- May need more qualification
- Can be high quality if from targeted content
- **Quality indicator:** Engagement depth (comments vs. likes)

**6. Email Marketing Responses**
- Already on your list — some relationship exists
- Clicked through on specific property or content
- May need nurturing before ready
- **Quality indicator:** Multiple opens/clicks vs. single interaction

### Tier 3: Cold Sources (Qualify before investing time)

**7. Exhibition/Event Leads**
- Large volume, highly variable quality
- Many are "just looking" or collecting brochures
- Require careful qualification
- **Quality indicator:** Notes from conversation, business card quality

**8. Purchased Lead Lists**
- Lowest quality, highest volume
- No existing relationship or interest signal
- Requires outbound approach
- **Quality indicator:** Data freshness and source

## Lead Quality Assessment Framework

Use this framework to quickly assess any lead:

### The BANT Criteria for Off-Plan

| Factor | High Quality Signal | Low Quality Signal |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Budget** | Stated range matches off-plan minimums | Vague or unrealistic expectations |
| **Authority** | Principal buyer or mandated advisor | "Asking for a friend" or unclear role |
| **Need** | Specific purpose (investment, visa, relocation) | "Just exploring options" |
| **Timeline** | Within 6 months | "Maybe next year" or "when the time is right" |

### Quick Qualification Questions

Within the first 2 minutes, establish:

1. "What's prompting you to look at Dubai property right now?"
2. "Have you invested in off-plan before, or would this be your first?"
3. "What's your target timeline for making a decision?"

---

## Portal Leads: Deep Dive

Property portals generate the highest volume of leads. Here's how to maximise conversion:

### Property Finder/Bayut Lead Anatomy

**What you receive:**
- Name and contact details
- Property they enquired about
- Any additional notes they've written
- Lead source timestamp

**What you don't receive (but need to discover):**
- Budget flexibility
- Alternative areas of interest
- Investment goals vs. end-use
- Decision-making authority

### Response Protocol

**Within 60 seconds:**
1. Acknowledge receipt
2. Confirm the property they enquired about
3. Ask one qualifying question

**Within 5 minutes:**
1. Attempt phone call
2. If no answer, send WhatsApp
3. Include a specific question to prompt response

**Why speed matters:**
- Leads contacted in 60 seconds convert 3x better
- After 5 minutes, conversion drops 80%
- After 30 minutes, you're competing against agents who were faster

---

## Developer Launch Leads

When developers share leads from launches, you have unique advantages:

**Advantages:**
- Specific project interest confirmed
- Developer provides presentation materials
- Often have payment plan flexibility
- Urgency from launch pricing

**Challenges:**
- Multiple agents may receive same lead
- Developer timeline pressures
- May have attended competing presentations

**Best practice:**
- Contact same day as launch
- Reference specific unit types or views
- Offer post-launch pricing comparison
- Create urgency around unit availability

---

## Referral Leads: The Gold Standard

Referral leads close at 4x the rate of portal leads. Here's why:

**What referrals bring:**
- Trust transferred from existing client
- Pre-qualification (referrer knows their capacity)
- Realistic expectations
- Higher lifetime value

**How to earn referrals:**
- Exceed expectations on every transaction
- Stay in touch post-completion
- Make referring easy (provide shareable content)
- Thank and update referrers on progress

---

## Lead Source Tracking

Track your conversion rates by source to optimise effort:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| **Leads per source** | Where to focus marketing |
| **Response time by source** | Where you're losing opportunities |
| **Qualification rate** | Source quality |
| **Conversion rate** | True ROI per source |
| **Average deal size** | Value per source |

**Target benchmarks:**
- Portal leads: 8-12% conversion to viewing
- Website enquiries: 15-20% conversion to viewing
- Referrals: 25-35% conversion to viewing

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Not all leads are equal** — Prioritise based on source and intent signals
2. **Speed wins on high-intent leads** — 60 seconds is your target
3. **Qualification saves time** — Don't spend an hour with someone who can't buy
4. **Track everything** — Data tells you where to focus
5. **Referrals are gold** — Every transaction is a referral opportunity

## Practice Exercise

Review your last 10 leads and categorise them:
- Which tier did each come from?
- How quickly did you respond?
- What was the outcome?

Identify one pattern that could improve your conversion rate.
