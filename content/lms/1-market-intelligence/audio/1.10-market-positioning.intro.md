Welcome to Module 1.10: Dubai vs Global Markets. International investors rarely consider Dubai in isolation. They are comparing it to London, Singapore, Miami, and other destinations. Your ability to handle these comparisons demonstrates expertise.

Here are the essentials:

First, know the yield advantage. Dubai delivers 6 to 8 percent gross yields—and that is also your net yield because there is no income tax. London nets around 2% after tax. Singapore offers 2 to 3% with 60% foreign buyer stamp duty.

Second, understand tax positioning. Zero personal income tax. Zero capital gains tax. Zero inheritance tax. For international investors, this is transformational for net returns.

Third, acknowledge trade-offs honestly. London has deeper liquidity and longer track record. Singapore has exceptional governance. Miami offers USD income. Being honest about alternatives builds trust.

Fourth, position residency as differentiator. The Golden Visa provides something London and Miami cannot—a path to long-term residency through property ownership.

Your key takeaway: Global investors want advisors who understand the alternatives. Know the competition—then let Dubai speak for itself.
