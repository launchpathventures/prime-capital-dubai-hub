## Questions

### Question 1
**Which contract type is used for off-plan property purchases from developers?**

A) Form F  
B) Ejari  
C) Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA)  
D) Form A  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) governs the relationship between buyer and developer for off-plan purchases. Form F is used for secondary market transactions, Ejari for rentals, and Form A for agency agreements.

---

### Question 2
**What is Form F used for in Dubai real estate?**

A) Agency agreement between agent and client  
B) Secondary market (resale) property transactions  
C) Off-plan developer sales  
D) Rental agreements  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Form F is the RERA-mandated Memorandum of Understanding for secondary market (resale) property transactions between buyer and seller.

---

### Question 3
**What is the standard deposit amount in Form F for secondary transactions?**

A) 5% of purchase price  
B) 10% of purchase price  
C) 20% of purchase price  
D) Fixed at AED 50,000  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The standard deposit for secondary market transactions is 10% of the purchase price, held by a conveyancing office until completion.

---

### Question 4
**Who should hold the deposit for a secondary market transaction?**

A) The buyer's agent  
B) The seller's agent  
C) A conveyancing office/trustee  
D) The seller directly  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Deposits should always be held by a neutral third party—a conveyancing office or licensed trustee. Never hold deposits as an agent, as this creates legal and ethical issues.

---

### Question 5
**What happens to the deposit if the buyer defaults on a Form F transaction?**

A) Deposit is returned to buyer  
B) Deposit is forfeited to seller  
C) Deposit is split between agents  
D) Deposit goes to RERA  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** If the buyer defaults (fails to complete without valid cause), the deposit is forfeited to the seller as compensation for the seller's lost time and opportunity.

---

### Question 6
**What is the primary purpose of the escrow account system for off-plan purchases?**

A) To simplify developer accounting  
B) To protect buyer funds by linking releases to construction progress  
C) To avoid taxation on property transactions  
D) To speed up the transaction process  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The escrow system protects buyer funds by holding them in a regulated account and only releasing funds to developers when construction milestones are certified by an independent engineer.

---

### Question 7
**What legal protection does Oqood registration provide?**

A) Immediate title deed issuance  
B) Protection against developer selling the same unit to multiple buyers  
C) Guaranteed property appreciation  
D) Exemption from property taxes  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Oqood registration records the buyer's interest with DLD, preventing double-selling and providing legal recognition of the buyer's claim to the property.

---

### Question 8
**What can a buyer do if the developer exceeds the grace period specified in the SPA?**

A) Nothing—they must wait indefinitely  
B) Request a partial refund only  
C) Cancel the contract and receive a full refund  
D) Sue the developer but cannot cancel  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** If the developer exceeds the grace period (typically 12 months beyond the stated completion date), the buyer has the right to cancel the contract and receive a full refund of all payments made.

---

### Question 9
**What is the defects liability period typically specified in SPAs?**

A) 6 months  
B) 12 months  
C) 5 years  
D) There is no standard period  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The defects liability period is typically 12 months from handover, during which the developer must repair any defects in workmanship or materials at no cost to the buyer.

---

### Question 10
**Which of the following is a red flag in a property contract that should be escalated?**

A) Payment to registered escrow account  
B) Payment requested to developer's personal account  
C) Standard 12-month grace period  
D) 10% deposit with trustee  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Any request to pay to a personal account (rather than the registered escrow account) is a major red flag. All off-plan payments must go through DLD-registered escrow accounts. This request should be refused and escalated immediately.
