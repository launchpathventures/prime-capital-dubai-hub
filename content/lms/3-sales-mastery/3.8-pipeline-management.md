# Pipeline Management

## Module 3.8 — Skills

Your pipeline is your business. Without discipline in managing it, you'll lose deals you should have won and waste time on deals that were never going to close. This module gives you the system.

## What Is a Sales Pipeline?

### Definition

Your pipeline is the organised view of all your active opportunities, categorised by stage from first contact to closed deal.

### Why It Matters

**Without pipeline management:**
- Leads fall through cracks
- Follow-ups get missed
- You can't predict your income
- You don't know where to focus

**With pipeline management:**
- Every lead has a next action
- Follow-ups happen systematically
- You can forecast with confidence
- You focus on highest-value activities

## Daily Pipeline Disciplines

### The Morning Review (10 minutes)

Every morning, before responding to new leads:

**1. Check overdue actions**
- What was supposed to happen yesterday that didn't?
- Prioritise these first

**2. Review today's scheduled activities**
- What calls/meetings are booked?
- What needs preparation?

**3. Identify stalled deals**
- Any deal in same stage for >7 days?
- What's the blocker? What action can move it?

**4. Count your pipeline**
- How many in each stage?
- Is it balanced or lopsided?

### The Follow-Up Block (30-60 minutes)

Dedicate time daily for proactive outreach:

**Priority order:**
1. EOIs pending SPA (highest value, closest to close)
2. Presenting stage with engagement (momentum deals)
3. Qualified stage awaiting response (keep warm)
4. Contacted stage for scheduling (build pipeline)

### The End-of-Day Update (5 minutes)

Before leaving work:

**1. Update every deal you touched**
- What happened?
- What's the next action?
- When?

**2. Set tomorrow's priorities**
- Top 3 deals to advance
- Key actions for each

## Pipeline Health Indicators

### Healthy Pipeline Signs

| Indicator | Healthy | Concern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **New leads/week** | Consistent flow | Feast or famine |
| **Stage distribution** | Balanced across stages | Bunched at one stage |
| **Average time in stage** | Within typical duration | Extended stays |
| **Conversion rates** | Predictable percentages | Erratic or declining |
| **Next actions set** | 100% of deals have next action | Orphan deals sitting |

### Warning Signs

**1. Top-Heavy Pipeline**
- Lots of new leads, few in presenting
- Problem: Qualification issues or poor follow-up

**2. Bottom-Heavy Pipeline**
- Many in presenting, few moving to EOI
- Problem: Closing issues or poor fit

**3. Stalled Deals**
- Deals sitting in one stage for weeks
- Problem: Missing follow-up or unresolved objection

**4. Pipeline Drought**
- Insufficient new leads entering
- Problem: Lead generation or market conditions

### Fixing Pipeline Problems

| Problem | Diagnosis | Solution |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Leads not converting to contacted | Response time too slow | Implement 60-second rule |
| Contacted not qualifying | Poor discovery conversations | Review needs analysis module |
| Qualified not presenting | Recommendations not matching | Improve property matching |
| Presenting not closing | Objections not handled | Review closing techniques |
| EOIs not converting | SPA concerns | Improve SPA walkthrough |

## Pipeline Metrics That Matter

### Key Metrics to Track

**Volume Metrics:**
- New leads per week
- Deals in each stage
- Total pipeline value (sum of all deal values)

**Velocity Metrics:**
- Average days in each stage
- Average days from lead to close
- Deals closed per month

**Conversion Metrics:**
- Lead to contacted %
- Contacted to qualified %
- Qualified to presenting %
- Presenting to EOI %
- EOI to booked %
- Overall conversion rate (lead to closed)

### Benchmarks for Off-Plan Sales

| Metric | Target | Acceptable | Concerning |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| Lead to contacted | >90% | 75-90% | <75% |
| Contacted to qualified | >40% | 25-40% | <25% |
| Qualified to presenting | >70% | 50-70% | <50% |
| Presenting to EOI | >25% | 15-25% | <15% |
| EOI to booked | >80% | 65-80% | <65% |
| **Overall conversion** | **>5%** | **3-5%** | **<3%** |

## CRM Best Practices

### What to Record for Every Deal

**Basic information:**
- Contact details
- Lead source
- Date received
- Current stage

**Discovery information:**
- Budget range
- Timeline
- Motivation (investment/visa/end-use)
- Key criteria

**Activity history:**
- Every contact (call, message, meeting)
- Every document sent
- Every objection raised
- Every response received

**Next action:**
- What needs to happen next
- When
- Any notes for context

### CRM Discipline Rules

1. **Update in real-time** — Don't batch updates at end of day
2. **Every deal has a next action** — No exceptions
3. **Next action has a date** — Not "soon" or "next week"
4. **Note the why** — Context helps future you
5. **Move stages promptly** — Keep stage accurate

---

## Forecasting from Your Pipeline

### The Weighted Pipeline Method

**Assign probability to each stage:**

| Stage | Conversion Probability |
|-------|----------------------|
| New Lead | 5% |
| Contacted | 10% |
| Qualified | 25% |
| Presenting | 40% |
| EOI Submitted | 75% |
| Booked | 95% |

**Calculate weighted pipeline:**

For each deal: Value × Probability = Weighted Value

Example:
- Deal A: AED 2M × 40% (presenting) = AED 800K weighted
- Deal B: AED 1.5M × 75% (EOI) = AED 1.125M weighted
- Deal C: AED 3M × 10% (contacted) = AED 300K weighted
- **Total weighted pipeline: AED 2.225M**

### Forecasting Accuracy

**Over time, track:**
- Predicted vs. actual closes
- Adjust probabilities based on your actual conversion rates
- Factor in your personal strengths (maybe you close higher at presenting stage)

## Weekly Pipeline Review

### What to Cover

**Every week, answer:**

1. **What closed last week?** — Celebrate wins, note lessons
2. **What should have closed but didn't?** — Why? What's the blocker?
3. **What's at risk?** — Deals stalled or going cold
4. **What's the focus this week?** — Top 3-5 deals to advance
5. **What's the lead flow?** — Enough new leads entering?

### Pipeline Review Cadence

| Review | Frequency | Focus |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Morning check | Daily | Today's actions |
| Pipeline update | Daily | Accurate stages |
| Deal review | Weekly | Health and focus |
| Forecast | Monthly | Revenue prediction |
