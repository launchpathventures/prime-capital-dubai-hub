# Property Matching Quiz 1: Yield & ROI Calculations

This quiz assesses your understanding of The Investment Score methodology and yield calculations.

**Passing score:** 80% (8 of 10 correct)  
**Time limit:** 15 minutes

## Question 1

What are the three components of The Investment Score methodology?

- A) Purchase price, rental income, service charges
- B) Gross yield, net yield, total return
- C) Location, size, view
- D) Developer tier, payment plan, completion date

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** The Investment Score methodology evaluates every property using three metrics: Gross yield (annual rent / purchase price), Net yield (after operating costs), and Total return (net yield + capital appreciation projection).

## Question 2

A property costs AED 1,350,000 and generates AED 102,000 in annual rent. What is the gross yield?

- A) 6.5%
- B) 7.6%
- C) 8.2%
- D) 5.5%

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Gross yield = (Annual rent / Purchase price) × 100 = (102,000 / 1,350,000) × 100 = 7.56%, rounded to 7.6%

## Question 3

When calculating net yield, which costs should be subtracted from gross rental income?

- A) Service charges only
- B) Service charges and DLD transfer fees
- C) Service charges, property management, vacancy allowance, and maintenance reserve
- D) Service charges, property management, and mortgage payments

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Net yield accounts for recurring operating costs: service charges, property management fees (typically 5%), vacancy allowance (typically 5%), and maintenance reserves (typically 1% of property value). Purchase costs (DLD fees) and financing costs (mortgage) are capital costs, not operating costs.

## Question 4

A 750 sqft apartment in Dubai Marina has service charges of AED 16 per sqft. What is the annual service charge?

- A) AED 11,250
- B) AED 12,000
- C) AED 15,000
- D) AED 16,000

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Annual service charge = Size × Rate = 750 sqft × AED 16/sqft = AED 12,000

---

## Question 5

According to the service charge benchmarks, which area typically has the LOWEST service charges per sqft?

- A) Palm Jumeirah
- B) Downtown Dubai
- C) JVC/JVT
- D) Dubai Marina

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** JVC/JVT typically has the lowest service charges at AED 10-14/sqft, compared to Marina (AED 14-25), Downtown (AED 18-35), and Palm (AED 20-45). This significantly impacts net yield calculations.

---

## Question 6

A property has a gross yield of 8.2% and annual operating costs that represent 38% of rental income. Approximately what is the net yield?

- A) 5.1%
- B) 3.1%
- C) 8.2%
- D) 6.5%

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation:** If costs are 38% of income, net income is 62% of gross income. Net yield ≈ 8.2% × 0.62 = 5.08%, approximately 5.1%.

---

## Question 7

When comparing a Marina 1BR (4.9% net yield, 6% projected appreciation) to a JVC 2BR (5.1% net yield, 4% projected appreciation), which has the higher total return?

- A) JVC 2BR at 9.1% total return
- B) Marina 1BR at 10.9% total return
- C) They are equal
- D) Cannot be determined

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Marina total return = 4.9% + 6.0% = 10.9%. JVC total return = 5.1% + 4.0% = 9.1%. Marina wins on total return despite lower yield because of stronger appreciation.

---

## Question 8

According to the Risk-Reward Matrix, which investment approach is recommended for a conservative investor (e.g., pension fund, retiree)?

- A) Off-plan in emerging areas with highest appreciation potential
- B) Ready property in established areas with focus on yield stability
- C) Any property with the highest gross yield
- D) Branded residences for prestige

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Conservative investors should focus on ready properties in established areas (Marina, Downtown, Palm) with emphasis on net yield stability and long-term hold (7-10 years). This minimises construction risk and provides predictable income.

## Question 9

Two apartments have identical AED 1,800,000 prices and AED 108,000 annual rent. Property A has service charges of AED 14/sqft (1,100 sqft), Property B has service charges of AED 28/sqft (1,100 sqft). What is the net yield difference?

- A) 0.4%
- B) 0.8%
- C) 1.2%
- D) No difference — both have same rent

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Property A costs: 1,100 × 14 = AED 15,400. Property B costs: 1,100 × 28 = AED 30,800. Difference: AED 15,400. This is 0.86% of purchase price (15,400/1,800,000), approximately 0.8% yield difference.

## Question 10

An investor asks: "What yield should I expect?" Which response best demonstrates The Investment Score approach?

- A) "Dubai yields are typically 6-7%"
- B) "This property yields about 5%"
- C) "The gross yield is 7.6%. After service charges of AED 12,000, management at 5%, and vacancy buffer, the net yield is 4.9%. With conservative 6% appreciation, total return is 10.9%."
- D) "Higher than London or Singapore"

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** The Investment Score approach requires presenting all three metrics: gross yield, net yield (with cost breakdown), and total return (including appreciation projection). Transparency and showing calculations builds trust with sophisticated investors.
