## Question 1

In a 60/40 payment plan, what does "60/40" refer to?

- A) 60% discount on the property, 40% commission
- B) 60% paid during construction, 40% paid on handover
- C) 60% of units sold, 40% remaining
- D) 60-month payment period, 40-month warranty

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** A 60/40 plan means 60% of the property price is paid in instalments during the construction period, and the remaining 40% is paid when the property is handed over to the buyer.

## Question 2

An investor has limited immediate capital but strong future cash flow. Which payment plan structure would likely suit them best?

- A) 80/20 (80% during construction, 20% on handover)
- B) 60/40 (60% during construction, 40% on handover)
- C) 40/60 (40% during construction, 60% post-handover)
- D) 10/90 (10% deposit, 90% on completion)

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** A 40/60 plan requires less capital during construction (40%) with the majority (60%) paid post-handover, often in instalments. This suits investors who can pay from future income or rental revenue. The 10/90 option requires 90% on completion day, which is a large single payment.

## Question 3

What is the primary purpose of RERA escrow accounts in off-plan transactions?

- A) To hold the consultant's commission until completion
- B) To protect buyer funds until construction milestones are met
- C) To pay the developer's construction costs upfront
- D) To collect service charges in advance

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** RERA escrow accounts protect buyer payments. Funds are held in a regulated account and released to the developer only when construction milestones are achieved. If a project is cancelled, escrow funds are returned to buyers.

## Question 4

A developer offers a property at AED 2,000,000 on a 60/40 plan, or AED 2,100,000 on a 40/60 plan. What is the premium for the extended terms?

- A) 2.5%
- B) 5%
- C) 10%
- D) AED 100,000 flat fee

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Premium = (2,100,000 - 2,000,000) / 2,000,000 × 100 = 5%. The 40/60 plan costs 5% more for the flexibility of lower upfront payments.

## Question 5

An investor is concerned about having a large payment due on handover day. Which payment plan would address this concern?

- A) 60/40
- B) 80/20
- C) 50/50
- D) 10/90

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** An 80/20 plan means most of the payment (80%) is made during construction, leaving only 20% due on handover. This reduces the final lump sum requirement compared to plans with larger handover payments.

---

## Question 6

When explaining payment plans to an investor, which approach demonstrates best practice?

- A) Recommend the plan that most buyers choose
- B) Convert percentages to actual amounts and discuss how they fit the investor's cash flow
- C) Always recommend the plan with the lowest handover payment
- D) Focus only on the booking amount since that's the immediate decision

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Best practice is to personalise the explanation: convert percentages to real AED amounts, map payments to the investor's timeline and cash flow situation, and let them make an informed decision based on their circumstances.

## Question 7

A property costs AED 1,500,000 with an 80/20 payment plan. Approximately how much would be due on handover?

- A) AED 150,000
- B) AED 300,000
- C) AED 600,000
- D) AED 1,200,000

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** On an 80/20 plan, 20% is due on handover. 20% of AED 1,500,000 = AED 300,000.

---

## Question 8

An investor asks: "What happens if I can't make a payment on time?" What is the correct response?

- A) "Don't worry, there's no penalty"
- B) "Most developers have some flexibility for genuine circumstances, typically 30-60 days. Repeated delays can trigger penalties. We'll review the SPA terms together before signing."
- C) "You'll lose the property immediately"
- D) "The developer will negotiate any payment schedule you want"

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** The accurate response acknowledges that some flexibility often exists while being clear about consequences. The specific terms are in the Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA), which should be reviewed before signing.

---

## Question 9

Which statement about post-handover payment plans is accurate?

- A) They are always interest-free
- B) They typically require paying from rental income
- C) They often carry a price premium compared to standard plans
- D) They are only available for properties under AED 1 million

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Post-handover plans (like 40/60) typically cost more than standard plans. Developers charge a premium for extending payment terms beyond handover because they're effectively providing financing. Whether they're interest-free varies by developer.

## Question 10

An investor is comparing two properties: Property A at AED 2,500,000 (60/40 plan) and Property B at AED 2,400,000 (cash purchase required). The investor has AED 2,000,000 available immediately. What should you explain?

- A) Property B is clearly better because it's cheaper
- B) Property A requires AED 1,500,000 during construction and AED 1,000,000 on handover; Property B requires AED 2,400,000 immediately — Property A fits their available capital while Property B would need additional financing
- C) Property A is clearly better because it has a payment plan
- D) The properties aren't comparable

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** The consultant should explain the cash flow implications clearly. Property A's 60/40 plan means AED 1,500,000 during construction (within their AED 2M available) with AED 1M on handover. Property B requires the full AED 2,400,000 upfront, exceeding their available capital. Neither is inherently "better" — it depends on whether the investor can access additional funds.
