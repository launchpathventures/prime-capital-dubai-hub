## Common Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Transfer Fee Payer

### Trap 2: Mortgage Registration vs Transfer Fee

**Question Pattern:** "What is the registration fee for a mortgage?"

- ✅ **Correct:** 0.25% of the mortgage amount
- ❌ **Wrong:** 4% (that's the transfer fee, not mortgage registration)

### Trap 3: Trustee Authorization

**Question Pattern:** "Who authorizes trustees to process transfers?"

- ✅ **Correct:** Dubai Land Department (DLD)
- ❌ **Wrong:** RERA or the developer

### Trap 4: NOC Validity

**Question Pattern:** "How long is an NOC valid?"

- **Answer:** It varies by developer (typically 30-60 days)
- Exam may ask about the need for NOC, not the exact validity period
