MODULE 3.4: Off-Plan Presentation Skills
TYPE: skills-script
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Presenting off-plan properties requires a different approach than ready properties. You're selling a vision, a developer's track record, and a financial proposition — not just a physical space.

Here's the challenge: buyers can't walk through the actual unit, see the finished views, experience the community, or touch the materials. So you must paint a vivid picture, build confidence in the developer, make the numbers clear, and address timeline concerns.

This module teaches you the BUILD framework for structuring compelling presentations. B for Background — establish developer and location credibility before introducing the property. U for Understanding Check — confirm the property matches their discovered needs. I for Investment Proposition — present the financial case clearly. L for Layout and Features — walk through the unit and development. D for Decision Pathway — explain next steps and timeline.

You'll learn to present payment plans with absolute clarity — breaking down booking fees, construction payments, and handover amounts into concrete figures. You'll also learn to discuss ROI projections honestly, building trust through conservative estimates rather than inflated promises.

Sophisticated investors see through aggressive projections. Honesty sells.

### DEMO (3-5 minutes)

**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of presenting an off-plan development to a UK investor who's looking for rental yield. Watch how the structure, credibility-building, and number presentation differ.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent jumps straight to property features]*

Agent: "Let me tell you about this amazing new development in Creek Harbour. It's going to be incredible — stunning views, world-class amenities, a huge pool, state-of-the-art gym. The apartments have premium finishes throughout. It's going to be the best building in the area."

Investor: "Okay, but who's the developer?"

Agent: "Oh, it's by one of the big developers. Very reliable."

Investor: "And what kind of returns can I expect?"

Agent: "Easily twelve to fifteen percent yield. Prices always go up in Dubai."

Investor: "That sounds... optimistic. How does the payment work?"

Agent: "You pay some now, some during construction, and some at the end. Standard stuff."

Investor: "I think I need to do more research..."

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Went Wrong**

Four critical errors. First, no developer credibility — saying "one of the big developers, very reliable" tells the investor nothing and actually raises concerns. Second, feature dump without context — listing amenities before understanding if they matter to THIS investor. Third, inflated projections — "easily twelve to fifteen percent" sounds like a sales pitch, not professional advice. And fourth, vague payment explanation — "some now, some during construction" leaves the investor confused about actual cash flow requirements.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent uses BUILD framework]*

Agent: "Before I show you the specific units, let me give you some context on the developer. Emaar has been in the Dubai market since 1997. They've delivered iconic projects like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, and the original Downtown district. Their last three projects delivered on time, which is important in this market where delays can happen.

This development, Creek Harbour Residences, is in the Creek Harbour district. This area has seen significant infrastructure investment — the new metro extension opens next year, and Dubai Square, a major retail destination, is under construction adjacent to the project. You're twelve minutes from Downtown, eight minutes from the airport.

Based on what you shared earlier — you're looking at rental yield as your primary driver, budget around one million dirhams, and you want hands-off management. This development fits that profile because one-beds in this area are in high rental demand and Emaar's property management division handles everything.

Before I go deeper, does this general direction feel right to you?"

Investor: "Yes, this sounds promising."

Agent: "Great. Let me walk you through the financial case. The unit we're looking at is priced at one point zero five million dirhams. The payment structure is thirty percent during construction, seventy percent on handover — a post-handover plan.

Here's the breakdown: booking is fifty thousand — that's about five percent. Then you pay fifteen percent over the next twelve months during construction. The remaining ten percent of the construction portion spreads over months thirteen to twenty-four. At handover, you pay the seventy percent balance, which many investors finance with a mortgage.

So your total outlay during construction is around three hundred and fifteen thousand dirhams, spread over two years. You're controlling a one million dirham asset with that amount while the developer builds.

For returns, let's be conservative. Similar completed units in Creek Harbour are achieving sixty-five to seventy thousand dirhams annual rent. On your purchase price, that's around six to six and a half percent gross yield. After service charges and management fees, you're looking at five to five and a half percent net.

Capital appreciation is harder to predict. This area has seen eight to ten percent annual growth historically, but I'd budget for five percent to be safe. Property markets fluctuate — I won't promise something I can't guarantee. What I can say is the fundamentals are strong: population growth, limited supply in this micro-market, and Emaar's brand premium on resale."

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Made It Work**

First, developer credibility established upfront — specific projects, track record on delivery. Second, location context — not just "great area" but specific infrastructure developments that affect value. Third, understanding check — confirming fit before going deep saves everyone time. Fourth, crystal-clear payment breakdown — actual numbers, not percentages in a vacuum. And fifth, honest projections — "five to five and a half percent net" and "budget for five percent appreciation" build trust. The investor knows they're getting real advice, not a sales pitch.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest difference? The strong example built credibility before asking for trust. When you establish the developer's track record and give honest numbers, investors feel advised rather than sold to. That's the foundation of consultative selling.
