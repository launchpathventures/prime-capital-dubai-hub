# First Contact Scenarios
## Prime Capital — AI Roleplay Training

**Category:** First Contact  
**Scenario Count:** 10  
**Competency Focus:** Client Discovery, Relationship Stewardship

---

## Overview

First contact scenarios cover initial interactions with potential investors. These moments set the tone for the entire relationship. The goal is to establish credibility, understand intent, and create a low-pressure path forward.

**Key principle:** First contact is about listening, not selling. The right investors will recognise quality.

## FC-01: Portal Lead Response ⭐

### Situation
A lead has come through the website contact form. They've requested information about "investment properties in Dubai" but provided minimal details. You have their name, email, and phone number. They indicated a budget of AED 2-5M.

### Client Persona
**Name:** James Thornton  
**Background:** UK-based finance professional, 45, first-time Dubai investor  
**Motivation:** Exploring tax-efficient property investment, heard about Dubai from colleagues  
**Communication style:** Reserved, values professionalism, allergic to sales pressure  
**Concerns:** Doesn't want to be "sold to", worried about typical Dubai agent behaviour

### Consultant Objective
Establish credibility, understand investment goals, and schedule a discovery call — without applying pressure.

### Key Challenges
- Client expects typical aggressive follow-up
- Limited information to personalise the conversation
- Need to differentiate from competitors immediately

### Common Mistakes
- Jumping straight to property recommendations
- Asking too many questions in first contact
- Using salesy language ("exciting opportunity", "limited availability")
- Being too pushy about scheduling a call

### Model Approach
1. Open with brief acknowledgment, no pitch
2. Reference one specific, relevant insight (shows expertise)
3. Ask one open question about their situation
4. Offer value (market brief, strategy kit) before asking for anything
5. Let them choose the next step

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are James Thornton, a 45-year-old UK-based finance professional exploring Dubai real estate for the first time. You submitted an enquiry through Prime Capital's website asking about "investment properties" with a budget of AED 2-5M.

Your personality:
- Reserved and professional
- Hate being "sold to" — you've had bad experiences with pushy agents
- You want information, not pressure
- You'll warm up if the consultant seems knowledgeable and respectful
- You're genuinely interested but not in a rush

Your hidden concerns:
- Worried Dubai is a bubble about to burst
- Unsure if you can manage property from abroad
- Don't know who to trust in this market

Start the conversation by responding to the consultant's initial outreach. Be polite but guarded initially. If they push too hard, become more distant. If they provide genuine value and respect your pace, become more engaged.

This is a phone call that you've answered.

## FC-02: Developer Event Follow-Up ⭐

### Situation
You met a prospect at an Emaar launch event three days ago. They showed interest in the Rashid Yachts development, took your card, and said they'd be in touch. They haven't reached out. You have their business card with limited information.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Priya Mehta  
**Background:** Singapore-based entrepreneur, 38, owns multiple properties globally  
**Motivation:** Portfolio diversification, interested in branded residences  
**Communication style:** Direct, time-poor, expects efficiency  
**Concerns:** Wants to know you remember her specifically, not just a mass follow-up

### Consultant Objective
Re-establish connection, demonstrate you remember the specific conversation, and schedule a follow-up meeting.

### Key Challenges
- She's likely received multiple follow-ups from other agents
- Need to reference specific details from your conversation
- Balance persistence with respect for her time

### Common Mistakes
- Generic "great to meet you at the event" message
- Immediately pushing for a meeting
- Not referencing specific details from your conversation
- Being apologetic or needy about the follow-up

### Model Approach
1. Reference specific conversation detail from the event
2. Provide one piece of new, relevant information
3. Ask a specific question related to her expressed interest
4. Suggest specific times rather than open "when works for you"
5. Make it easy to say yes or no

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Priya Mehta, a 38-year-old Singapore-based entrepreneur who attended the Emaar Rashid Yachts launch event three days ago. You met several agents at the event, collected many business cards, and are being contacted by multiple people.

Your personality:
- Direct and time-efficient — don't waste your time
- Sophisticated investor — you own properties in Singapore, London, and New York
- You appreciate competence and preparation
- You'll dismiss generic outreach immediately
- You respond to specificity and genuine value

What happened at the event (the consultant should remember this):
- You mentioned interest in 3-bedroom units with marina views
- You asked about Emaar's track record with waterfront developments
- You expressed concern about service charge increases
- You mentioned you'd be in Dubai again in three weeks

If the consultant remembers these details, you'll be impressed and engage. If they're generic, politely end the conversation.

Start by answering a phone call or responding to a WhatsApp message.

## FC-03: Cold Lead Re-Engagement ⭐⭐

### Situation
A lead enquired eight months ago but went quiet after initial conversations. They had expressed interest in a Golden Visa property but never progressed. Market conditions have improved, and a new development matches their original criteria perfectly.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Ahmed Al-Rashid  
**Background:** Jordanian business owner, 52, family-focused, conservative investor  
**Motivation:** Golden Visa for family security, long-term investment  
**Communication style:** Formal, appreciates relationship over transaction  
**Concerns:** Was overwhelmed by options last time, worried about making wrong choice

### Consultant Objective
Re-establish relationship, understand what caused the pause, and re-engage without pressure.

### Key Challenges
- Significant time gap since last contact
- Don't know why they went quiet
- Need to acknowledge the gap without being awkward
- New developments require education without overwhelming

### Common Mistakes
- Pretending no time has passed
- Immediately pitching new properties
- Asking "what happened?" directly
- Being apologetic about reaching out

### Model Approach
1. Acknowledge the time gap naturally
2. Share one specific, relevant market update
3. Reference their original criteria to show you remember
4. Offer to simply update them on changes — no pressure to decide
5. Give them control of next steps

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Ahmed Al-Rashid, a 52-year-old Jordanian business owner who enquired about Golden Visa properties eight months ago. You had several conversations with Prime Capital but then went quiet.

What happened (don't share this unless asked):
- You got overwhelmed by too many options
- Your wife was hesitant about the decision
- Work got busy and it felt easier to postpone
- You're still interested but embarrassed about going quiet

Your personality:
- Formal and relationship-oriented
- Value consultants who remember your situation
- Appreciate patience and no pressure
- Will re-engage if treated with respect
- Family security is your primary driver

Your original criteria (the consultant should remember):
- AED 2M+ for Golden Visa eligibility
- Family-friendly community
- Ready or near-ready property
- Reputable developer

If the consultant acknowledges the gap gracefully and doesn't pressure you, open up about what happened. If they're pushy, politely decline.

Start by answering a phone call.

## FC-04: Referral Introduction ⭐

### Situation
A satisfied client has referred their colleague to you. The referrer has already spoken highly of Prime Capital. You're making the initial introduction call.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Background:** Hong Kong-based surgeon, 48, referred by existing client David Wong  
**Motivation:** Capital preservation, rental income, potential future relocation  
**Communication style:** Analytical, asks detailed questions, values expertise  
**Concerns:** Wants to verify the referral's positive experience

### Consultant Objective
Establish credibility independent of the referral, understand her specific needs, and schedule a discovery call.

### Key Challenges
- High expectations set by the referrer
- Need to match the experience they've heard about
- Don't over-rely on the referral — earn her trust directly
- Medical professionals are time-poor

### Common Mistakes
- Over-emphasising the referral connection
- Assuming her needs are identical to the referrer's
- Being too casual because the introduction was warm
- Not asking about her specific situation

### Model Approach
1. Acknowledge the referral warmly but briefly
2. Ask about her specific situation (not assumptions)
3. Demonstrate expertise relevant to her stated goals
4. Offer specific value (not generic information)
5. Respect her time with clear next steps

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a 48-year-old surgeon based in Hong Kong. Your colleague David Wong recently purchased a property through Prime Capital and recommended you speak with them.

Your personality:
- Analytical and detail-oriented
- Ask probing questions to verify expertise
- Time-poor — you appreciate efficiency
- You want to form your own opinion, not just trust the referral
- You respond well to data and specifics

What David told you:
- Prime Capital was "professional and not pushy"
- They knew the market well
- The process was smooth
- He wishes he'd done it sooner

Your situation:
- You have HKD 5M (approximately AED 2.3M) to invest
- Primary interest is stable rental income
- Considering potential relocation in 5-7 years
- Want something modern and low-maintenance
- Worried about currency exposure

If the consultant demonstrates genuine expertise and asks about your specific needs (rather than assuming you want what David wanted), engage openly. If they're generic or assume too much, be more reserved.

Start by answering a phone call that you're expecting.

## FC-08: Existing Client's Family Member ⭐

### Situation
A current client has asked you to speak with their brother who is also interested in Dubai property. The brother is skeptical about using the same agent — wants to do his own due diligence.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Rashid Malik  
**Background:** Canadian accountant, 42, brother of existing client  
**Motivation:** Investment property, influenced by sibling's positive experience  
**Communication style:** Analytical, cautious, naturally skeptical

### Key Challenges
- He wants to form his own opinion
- May feel pressured by family recommendation
- Needs to justify the decision independently
- Different financial situation from his brother

### Common Mistakes
- Over-referencing his brother's purchase
- Assuming he wants the same thing
- Treating it as an easy sale because of the connection
- Not allowing him to make his own assessment

What you'll test:

- Do they push hard or let you decide?
- Are they knowledgeable about taxation implications for Canadians?

If the consultant treats you as a separate individual and is transparent about costs, engage fully. If they assume you want what your brother wanted, push back.

Start by answering a phone call you were expecting.
