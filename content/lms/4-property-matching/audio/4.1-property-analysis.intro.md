Welcome to Property Analysis Framework — where you'll learn to evaluate properties systematically, not by gut feel.

Here's the problem: when an investor asks "Why this property?" — you need a clear answer that connects back to what they told you. "It felt like a good fit" doesn't cut it.

In this module, you'll learn a three-stage framework. First, hard filters — the non-negotiables that eliminate properties immediately. Second, soft preferences — the "nice to haves" that you'll score and weight. Third, deal quality — even a good fit needs good terms.

The goal? A shortlist of three to five properties, each with documented rationale you can explain and defend.

By the end, you'll move from "I think this works" to "Here's exactly why this property matches your requirements." That's the difference between a salesperson and an advisor.

Let's get into the framework.
