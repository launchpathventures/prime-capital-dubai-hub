### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

Let me walk you through conducting a thorough snagging inspection—your last opportunity to catch issues while the developer is still responsible for fixing them.

CONTEXT: When you'll use this and why it matters.

Snagging happens at off-plan handover, after the developer issues completion notice and before your client accepts keys. What you document here gets fixed under warranty. What you miss, your client lives with. This inspection is the difference between a client who thanks you for protecting their interests and one who discovers problems after they've accepted ownership.

THE PROCESS: Step-by-step walkthrough with practical tips.

Step one—prepare before the handover appointment. Bring the specification sheet from the SPA—this lists what the developer promised. Bring a flashlight for checking under cabinets and in corners. Bring your phone fully charged for photos. Bring a notepad for written observations. Bring a small ball or marble to check floor level.

Step two—work through each room systematically. Don't rush from room to room noticing obvious issues. Start at the entrance and work methodically around each space, examining walls, floors, ceiling, fixtures, and fittings before moving to the next area.

Step three—inspect walls and ceilings carefully. Look for paint cracks, uneven finish, patches, chips, or damage. Run your hand along walls to feel for bumps or rough spots the eye might miss. Check corners are straight and clean. Look at ceiling-wall joints for gaps or uneven lines.

Step four—examine floors thoroughly. Look for cracked, chipped, or loose tiles. Check grout lines are complete and even. For wooden floors, look for scratches, lifting edges, or gaps. Use a marble or ball to check if floors are level—it shouldn't roll to one corner.

Step five—test every door and window. Open and close each one. Check they swing smoothly without sticking or scraping. Test every lock. Verify handles are secure. Look for damaged frames, scratched glass, or missing seals. Check window seals are tight.

Step six—inspect kitchen in detail. Open every cabinet door and drawer. Check alignment, smooth operation, soft-close function if specified. Examine countertops for chips, cracks, or stains. Run all taps and check for leaks. Verify appliances are correct brands and models per specification. Test that each appliance functions.

Step seven—check bathrooms thoroughly. Test toilet flush and check for leaks at base. Run all taps and check hot water arrives. Test shower drainage—water should drain quickly without pooling. Inspect all tiles and grout. Look for chips in fixtures. Check mirrors and glass for damage.

Step eight—verify electrical systems. Test every light switch. Check every power outlet works—bring a phone charger to test. Test AC on all settings and listen for unusual sounds. Verify intercom and smart systems function.

Step nine—document every issue properly. For each problem: note the exact location, describe the issue clearly, take a photograph. Name photos systematically so you can reference them later—unit number, room, location, issue type.

Step ten—present findings and negotiate resolution. Share your snagging list with the developer representative. Walk through each issue together. Agree on what will be fixed and the timeline. Get written acknowledgment with committed dates. For minor issues, accept keys with fixes scheduled. For significant issues, consider delaying acceptance until resolved.

COMMON PITFALLS: Mistakes to avoid.

First, rushing the inspection. Developers schedule tight handover windows. Don't let time pressure make you superficial. Request more time if needed.

Second, accepting verbal commitments. "We'll fix that" means nothing without written acknowledgment and timeline.

Third, ignoring the specification sheet. If the SPA promised a specific appliance brand and a cheaper alternative is installed, that's a valid snagging point.

PRO TIP: One insider technique.

Take a video walkthrough in addition to photos. Walk through each room narrating what you see. "Master bedroom, looking at north wall, visible crack approximately fifteen centimeters below ceiling." Videos capture context that photos miss and create an undeniable record of property condition at handover.
