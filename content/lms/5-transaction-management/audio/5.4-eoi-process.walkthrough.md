Let me walk you through the EOI submission process step by step—from the moment your client decides on a unit to the moment you have confirmed reservation in hand.

CONTEXT: When you'll use this and why it matters.

EOI is where deals are won or lost in real-time. Popular units in desirable projects sell within hours, sometimes minutes. Your ability to execute this process quickly and accurately determines whether your client gets their chosen unit or watches it go to someone else. There's no margin for fumbling.

THE PROCESS: Step-by-step walkthrough with practical tips.

Step one—confirm availability before anything else. Before your client commits emotionally to a unit, verify it's actually available. Call or message the developer sales team directly: "Confirming unit two-zero-seven in Tower B is available for reservation." Get written confirmation if possible—units are selling while you're talking.

Step two—complete the EOI form accurately. Pull up your client's passport and enter their name exactly as it appears—every letter, every space, no variations. Enter passport number, expiry date, Emirates ID if resident, contact details. Fill in the unit number, purchase price from the current price list, and selected payment plan. Double-check every field. Errors now become problems at title deed stage.

Step three—execute the deposit payment. Confirm exact bank details for the escrow account. Read them back to your client: account name, account number, IBAN, bank name. Have your client initiate the transfer while you're together if possible. The moment the transfer is confirmed, send proof to the developer immediately.

Step four—submit documentation. Compile the signed EOI form, passport copy, Emirates ID copy if applicable, and payment confirmation. Submit via the developer's preferred method—email, portal upload, or in-person. Request immediate acknowledgment of receipt.

Step five—obtain confirmation. Follow up within hours, not days. Get written confirmation that the unit is reserved in your client's name with a reference number. Clarify when the SPA will be ready—typically seven to fourteen days.

COMMON PITFALLS: Mistakes to avoid.

First, assuming availability. Never let your client fall in love with a unit before confirming it's available. Check first, present second.

Second, name discrepancies. "John Smith" on the EOI but "John Robert Smith" on the passport creates problems. Match exactly.

Third, delayed payment follow-up. Sending transfer proof an hour later is too slow when multiple agents are competing for the same unit. Send immediately.

PRO TIP: One insider technique.

Prepare before EOI day. Pre-fill the EOI form with any information you already have. Verify bank details the day before. Confirm unit availability that morning. Identify two or three backup units in case the first choice sells. When you walk into the EOI meeting fully prepared, you can execute in fifteen minutes instead of forty-five. Speed wins units.
