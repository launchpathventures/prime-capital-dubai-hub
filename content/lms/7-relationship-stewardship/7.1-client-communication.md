# Client Communication Standards

Every message you send represents Prime Capital. This module establishes the communication standards that maintain our "antidote to the Dubai hustle" positioning.

## The Communication Principle

> **Quality over quantity. Relevance over frequency.**

Our clients are busy professionals. They don't want more messages — they want better ones. Every communication should pass a simple test: *Does this deserve their attention?*

## Response Time Standards

### The 2-Hour Rule (Active Clients)

For clients in an active transaction or those who have completed within the last 90 days:

**Standard:** Respond to every message within 2 business hours.

This doesn't mean a complete answer in 2 hours — it means acknowledgment and setting expectations:

> "Got your message about the payment schedule question. I'm checking with the developer's finance team now and will have clarity for you by end of day."

**Why 2 hours?** Your active clients are comparing you to other agents. They've likely contacted multiple people. The consultant who responds first, with substance, wins the relationship.

### The 24-Hour Rule (All Clients)

For all clients — active, past, or prospective:

**Standard:** Acknowledge every communication within 24 hours, even if you can't provide a complete answer yet.

**Example acknowledgment:**
> "Thank you for your message. I'm gathering the information you've requested and will have a full response for you by [specific day]. Please let me know if you need anything more urgently."

**Why this matters:** Fast acknowledgment shows you're attentive. Promising a specific timeline shows you're organised. Both build trust.

### When to Respond Immediately

Some messages warrant same-hour response:

- **Time-sensitive opportunities** — A property they expressed interest in has an update
- **Transaction milestones** — Completion dates, payment deadlines, document requirements
- **Direct questions with simple answers** — Don't make them wait for basic information
- **Expressions of concern** — If a client seems worried, address it promptly
- **Complaints or issues** — Never let a complaint sit unanswered

### When Not to Rush

Conversely, don't sacrifice quality for speed:

- **Complex analysis requests** — Take the time to be thorough
- **Sensitive topics** — Think carefully before responding
- **After-hours messages** — Unless genuinely urgent, respond the next business day

## The Prime Capital Voice in Writing

### What Our Clients Expect

Our clients are sophisticated. They recognise quality in communication just as they recognise quality in property. They expect:

- **Clarity** — No jargon, no ambiguity
- **Brevity** — Get to the point
- **Substance** — Real information, not filler
- **Professionalism** — Proper grammar, careful formatting

### Email Structure

Use this structure for most client emails:

1. **Opening line** — Acknowledge context or previous conversation
2. **Core message** — The main information, clearly stated
3. **Next steps** — What happens now, who does what
4. **Closing** — Professional sign-off with availability

**Example:**

> Good afternoon [Name],
>
> Following our conversation about Emaar Beachfront, I've confirmed availability for Unit 1502 in the tower we discussed.
>
> Key details:
> - 3-bedroom, 2,100 sq ft
> - Price: AED 4.2M
> - Completion: Q4 2027
> - Payment plan: 60/40
>
> I've attached the floor plan and specification sheet. The developer is holding three units at this price point, so this availability window is likely 7-10 days.
>
> Would you like to schedule a call to discuss further? I'm available tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning.
>
> Best regards,
> [Your name]

### Language to Use

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Direct | "The completion date has been confirmed as March 2027." |
| Specific | "The price includes a 15% completion discount until February 28." |
| Confident | "I recommend reviewing the upper floors for better views." |
| Helpful | "I'll prepare a comparison of both options for your review." |

### Language to Avoid

| Avoid | Better Alternative |
|-------|-------------------|
| "I just wanted to check in..." | "Following up on our conversation about..." |
| "Hope this email finds you well" | Get straight to the purpose |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out" | "Let me know if you have questions" |
| "Best in class" / "World-leading" | Be specific about what makes it notable |
| Exclamation marks | Period. Professional tone. |

## Choosing Communication Channels

### Email

**Best for:**
- Detailed information that clients may need to reference later
- Attachments (documents, floor plans, contracts)
- Formal communications that need a paper trail
- Non-urgent updates

**Structure tip:** Use formatting (bullet points, headers) for longer emails. Make them scannable.

### Phone / Video Call

**Best for:**
- Complex discussions requiring back-and-forth
- Sensitive topics (pricing negotiations, concerns)
- Building rapport with new clients
- Urgent matters

**Protocol:** Always confirm the call with a brief agenda. Follow up with a summary email capturing key points and next steps.

### WhatsApp / Messaging

**Best for:**
- Quick, time-sensitive updates
- Confirming appointments
- Sharing quick photos or videos
- Clients who prefer this channel

**Caution:** WhatsApp can feel informal. Maintain professional tone. Don't send long messages — if it needs more than a paragraph, use email.

### In-Person Meetings

**Best for:**
- Property viewings
- Contract signing
- Relationship-building moments
- High-stakes discussions

**Protocol:** Always follow up with a written summary of what was discussed and agreed.

## Cultural Considerations by Nationality

Dubai's investor base is truly international. Adapting your communication style shows respect and builds trust faster.

### British Clients

- **Communication style:** Formal, understated, values politeness
- **What works:** Reserved confidence, avoiding overselling, self-deprecating humour
- **What doesn't:** Aggressive selling, excessive enthusiasm, pushing for quick decisions
- **Tip:** "I'd recommend..." works better than "You should..."

### Indian Clients

- **Communication style:** Relationship-first, family-oriented, values personal connection
- **What works:** Building rapport before business, asking about family, patience with decision-making
- **What doesn't:** Rushing the relationship, ignoring family dynamics
- **Tip:** Decisions often involve multiple family members — accommodate this

### Chinese Clients

- **Communication style:** Indirect, face-conscious, respects hierarchy
- **What works:** Patience, avoiding public disagreement, written confirmation of everything
- **What doesn't:** Direct confrontation, putting them on the spot
- **Tip:** "Let me check on that" is better than "No" — give face-saving options

### Russian Clients

- **Communication style:** Direct, values expertise, appreciates straightforwardness
- **What works:** Demonstrating knowledge, clear facts and figures, direct recommendations
- **What doesn't:** Vagueness, excessive small talk before business
- **Tip:** They appreciate confident expertise — be ready to back it up with data

### Middle Eastern Clients (GCC)

- **Communication style:** Relationship-based, hospitable, values trust over contracts
- **What works:** Taking time for pleasantries, flexibility, building personal trust
- **What doesn't:** Rushing to business, rigid processes
- **Tip:** Coffee/tea before business is expected — never decline hospitality

### European Clients (Continental)

- **Communication style:** Varies by country, generally formal, values professionalism
- **What works:** Punctuality, detailed documentation, process clarity
- **What doesn't:** Informal first-name basis too early, unstructured meetings
- **Tip:** Germans and Swiss particularly value precise information and timelines

### General Principles

- **Research before meetings** — Understand basic cultural norms
- **When in doubt, be more formal** — It's easier to relax than recover from offense
- **Follow their lead** — Let them set the communication tone
- **Never assume** — Ask about preferences rather than stereotyping

## Professional Boundaries

### Availability Expectations

Set clear expectations about your availability:

- **Standard business hours:** Clients can expect same-day response (2-hour for active)
- **Evenings and weekends:** You'll respond next business day unless urgent
- **Holiday periods:** Set out-of-office with alternative contact
- **Religious holidays:** Be aware of Ramadan, Diwali, Chinese New Year — acknowledge them

Communicate these expectations early in the relationship. Most clients respect boundaries when they're clearly stated.

### Personal vs. Professional

Build rapport, but maintain appropriate distance:

- **Do:** Remember personal details (family, interests, upcoming travel)
- **Do:** Acknowledge significant events (congratulations on a new role)
- **Don't:** Over-share personal information
- **Don't:** Make the relationship feel transactional by only reaching out for business
- **Do:** Send festival greetings appropriate to their culture

### Handling Difficult Conversations

Sometimes you'll need to deliver unwelcome news — a delayed completion, a price increase, a document issue.

**Approach:**
1. **Be direct** — Don't bury bad news in paragraphs of preamble
2. **Be factual** — Stick to what you know, not speculation
3. **Be solution-oriented** — What can be done now?
4. **Be available** — Offer to discuss by phone if they prefer

**Example — Delivering Bad News:**
> "I need to share an update on the completion timeline. [Developer] has notified us of a three-month delay to the Marina Gate project, with the revised completion now scheduled for September 2027.
>
> I know this isn't the news you were hoping for. I've reviewed the contract terms, and there are no financial implications for you from this delay. The developer has also offered [compensation/incentive] for affected buyers.
>
> I'm available to discuss this by phone whenever suits you. Would tomorrow morning work?"

## 🎧 Coach Walkthrough: Handling a Client Complaint

*This section demonstrates how to handle an upset client professionally while maintaining the relationship.*

<speak>
**Coach:** Let's walk through handling a client complaint. This is one of the most important skills you'll develop — done well, a complaint can actually strengthen the relationship. Done poorly, you lose the client and any referrals.

The client — Sarah — purchased an off-plan apartment six months ago. She's just discovered that the view from her unit will be partially obstructed by a new tower that wasn't in the original plans. She's upset and has called you directly.

**Client (Sarah):** "I just found out there's another tower going up that's going to block half my view. You never mentioned this when I bought. I feel like I've been misled."

**Coach:** Notice she's emotional. Your first job is NOT to defend yourself. It's to acknowledge her feelings. Watch:

**Consultant:** "Sarah, I can hear how frustrated you are, and I completely understand. A view was an important part of your purchase decision, and this news is genuinely disappointing. Thank you for bringing this to me directly."

**Coach:** See what happened there? I didn't argue. I didn't explain. I acknowledged her emotion and thanked her for telling me. This defuses the initial heat. Now watch how I move to understanding:

**Consultant:** "Can you tell me exactly what you've learned? I want to make sure I understand the situation fully before we discuss what can be done."

**Coach:** I'm not assuming I know the problem. I'm asking HER to explain. This gives her control and often reveals whether it's as bad as she thinks.

**Client:** "The sales guy at the developer's office told me there's a new tower being built on the adjacent plot. He said it wasn't in the original masterplan."

**Consultant:** "I see. Let me look into this immediately. I'm going to contact the developer's project team directly and get the exact specifications — height, distance from your unit, timeline. Can I call you back within two hours with what I find?"

**Coach:** I've committed to a specific action and a specific timeframe. Not "I'll look into it" — that's vague. "Within two hours" shows urgency and respect for her concern.

**Client:** "Fine. But I'm really unhappy about this."

**Consultant:** "I understand, and you have every right to be. Whatever I find, we'll work through the options together. If there's been a genuine change that affects your investment, we'll address it properly."

**Coach:** I've validated her feelings again and signaled that I'm on her side. Now here's the critical follow-up:

**After the call — your actions:**

1. **Document everything** — Note the date, time, her specific concerns
2. **Investigate immediately** — Don't wait. Contact the developer now.
3. **Call back early** — If you said two hours, call in ninety minutes
4. **Come with options** — Even if the news is bad, have suggestions ready

**On the follow-up call:**

**Consultant:** "Sarah, I've spoken with the developer's project team. Here's what I've learned: yes, there is a new tower planned on the adjacent plot. However, it's 45 meters from your tower and the height means it affects your view from the bedroom, not the living room which faces the other direction. I've attached the updated masterplan showing the exact positioning.

I also asked about options. They've confirmed that if you wanted to consider switching to a higher floor unit in the same tower, they would accommodate that with only the price difference — no penalties. Alternatively, they're offering a furniture package worth AED 50,000 for affected units.

I know neither of these makes the situation perfect. But I wanted you to have clear information and options. What would you like to discuss first?"

**Coach:** Notice I came back with facts, options, and put her in control of the next step. Even if she's still disappointed, she now knows I'm working for her, not against her.

**Key Principles for Complaint Handling:**

1. **Acknowledge before defending** — Emotions first, facts second
2. **Thank them for telling you** — They could have just disappeared
3. **Commit to specific action** — Not vague promises
4. **Follow up early** — Beat your deadline
5. **Come with options** — Even if imperfect
6. **Document everything** — Protect yourself and the relationship

## Putting It Into Practice

### Daily Habits

- Review your inbox at consistent times (morning, after lunch, end of day)
- Flag messages requiring more time, and schedule that time
- Before sending, re-read from the client's perspective

### Weekly Review

- Check for any clients you haven't been in touch with recently
- Review any outstanding follow-ups
- Update your CRM with recent interactions

### Quality Check

Before sending any client communication, ask:

- [ ] Does this deserve their attention?
- [ ] Is it clear what I'm communicating?
- [ ] Is there a specific next step or call to action?
- [ ] Does the tone match Prime Capital's voice?
- [ ] Have I proofread for errors?
