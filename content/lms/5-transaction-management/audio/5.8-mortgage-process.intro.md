Mortgage delays kill deals. A client signs an MOU, commits ten percent deposit, and then discovers their bank approval takes longer than expected. Now they're facing forfeiture of hundreds of thousands of dirhams because nobody managed the financing timeline properly.

Here's how to prevent mortgage disasters.

First, know the eligibility basics. UAE residents can borrow up to eighty percent for a first property, sixty percent for investment. Non-residents face stricter limits—fifty to sixty percent maximum. These aren't suggestions; they're Central Bank regulations.

Second, pre-approval should happen before committing to a property, not after. If your client needs financing, connect them with a mortgage broker immediately. Discovering they don't qualify after signing an MOU is a disaster.

Third, timeline is typically two to four weeks from application to approval—but complicated cases take longer. For secondary transactions with thirty to sixty day completion windows, you have no room for delays. Start the mortgage process the day after MOU signing.

Fourth, valuation gaps happen. If the bank values the property lower than purchase price, the client must cover the difference in cash or renegotiate. Prepare clients for this possibility.

The key takeaway: Mortgage coordination is your responsibility, not just the client's or broker's. Track approval status, align timelines with transaction deadlines, and escalate problems immediately. The agent who manages financing proactively closes deals. The one who assumes it will work out loses them.
