# Closing Techniques

## Introduction

Closing isn't manipulation — it's helping someone who's ready to buy actually make the decision. This module teaches you to recognise when they're ready and guide them confidently to commitment.

## The Philosophy of Closing

### What Closing Actually Is

**Wrong view:** "Closing is about getting them to say yes"
**Right view:** "Closing is about removing barriers for someone who wants to buy"

If someone doesn't want your property, no technique will change that. But if someone does want it and is hesitating due to uncertainty, fear, or indecision — that's where closing skills matter.

### The Prime Capital Approach

We don't use:
- High-pressure tactics
- Manipulation
- False urgency
- Guilt or shame

We do use:
- Clear communication
- Confidence in our recommendations
- Help with decision-making
- Respect for their timeline

## Recognising Buying Signals

### Verbal Buying Signals

**Direct signals (high confidence):**
- "How do we proceed?"
- "What's the next step?"
- "Can I reserve this unit?"
- "I want this one."

**Indirect signals (medium-high confidence):**
- "What's included in the price?"
- "When is the handover date?"
- "Can I do the paperwork remotely?"
- "What's the payment schedule again?"

**Conditional signals (medium confidence):**
- "If I were to proceed..."
- "Assuming the developer is reliable..."
- "This would work if..."

**Question clusters:**
- Asking multiple logistical questions in succession
- Revisiting details they've already covered
- Asking about post-purchase matters (rental, management)

### Non-Verbal Buying Signals

**In person:**
- Leaning forward during conversation
- Taking notes
- Asking partner for opinion
- Reviewing floor plan repeatedly
- Checking phone less frequently

**On calls/video:**
- Longer pauses (thinking it through)
- Asking to see documents again
- Involving others in the conversation
- More animated tone

### Signal Progression

| Stage | Signal Type | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Early interest** | General questions | "Tell me more about the area" |
| **Active consideration** | Specific questions | "Which units have best views?" |
| **Near decision** | Logistics questions | "How does the EOI work?" |
| **Ready to buy** | Process questions | "What do I need to sign?" |

## Closing Techniques

### Technique 1: The Assumptive Close

**When to use:** When you've received clear buying signals and the decision feels natural.

**How it works:** Assume the decision is made, focus on logistics.

**Script:**

> "Great, it sounds like [Unit X] is the right fit. Let me walk you through what happens next. I'll send over the EOI form now — do you prefer to complete it digitally or would you like me to talk you through each section?"

**Why it works:**
- Removes the "big decision" feeling
- Makes the next step feel natural
- Doesn't force them to explicitly say "yes"

### Technique 2: The Summary Close

**When to use:** When they've expressed multiple positive points but haven't committed.

**How it works:** Summarise everything they've agreed with, then ask for commitment.

**Script:**

> "Let me make sure I've captured this correctly. You liked [Development] because of [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3]. The payment plan works within your budget, and the timeline fits your goals. It checks all your boxes. Shall we secure this unit for you?"

**Why it works:**
- Reminds them why they're interested
- Creates momentum through agreement
- Makes the logical conclusion obvious

### Technique 3: The Alternative Close

**When to use:** When they're interested but haven't decided on specifics.

**How it works:** Offer two positive options rather than yes/no.

**Script:**

> "So we've narrowed it down to the two-bedroom on floor 12 or the one on floor 18. The 18th floor has better views, the 12th is slightly more affordable. Which would you prefer to secure?"

**Why it works:**
- Assumes they're buying (just deciding which)
- Focuses on details, not the yes/no decision
- Gives them control within a positive framework

### Technique 4: The Urgency Close (Use with Integrity)

**When to use:** Only when the urgency is genuine.

**How it works:** Share a real constraint that creates a decision point.

**Script:**

> "I want to be transparent with you: this unit is one of the last at this price point, and I know [another client/colleague's client] is also considering it. I can't guarantee it will be available tomorrow. Would you like to secure it now to avoid that risk?"

**Why it works:**
- Creates legitimate reason to decide
- Positions you as honest advisor
- Only works if true

**Warning:** Never fabricate urgency. If discovered, trust is destroyed permanently.

### Technique 5: The Trial Close

**When to use:** When you're unsure if they're ready.

**How it works:** Test their readiness with a soft question.

**Script:**

> "If everything we've discussed checks out — the location, the payment plan, the developer — is this something you'd want to move forward with?"

**Follow-up based on response:**
- "Yes" → Move to assumptive close
- "Maybe, but..." → Address the concern, then close
- "Not sure" → More discovery needed

## Handling Last-Minute Objections

### Common Close-Stage Objections

**"I need to think about it"**

> "Of course — it's a significant decision. What specifically would you like to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need.
>
> [Listen for real concern]
>
> Remember, the EOI holds your position while you think, and it's fully refundable. That way you can take your time without risking availability."

**"The price is higher than I expected"**

> "I understand. Help me understand the gap — what were you expecting, and what's the difference?
>
> [Listen]
>
> Let me show you why this is priced where it is compared to alternatives. [Justify value or suggest alternatives within budget]"

**"I'm worried about the developer"**

> "That's a smart concern. Let me share what gives us confidence in [Developer]:
>
> - Track record: [specific projects delivered]
> - Escrow protection: [explain RERA regulation]
> - Our experience: [any direct experience with this developer]
>
> What specifically would give you more confidence?"

**"I should check other options first"**

> "I respect that — you should feel confident in your decision. Can I ask what other options you're comparing this to?
>
> [Listen]
>
> [If you can address] Let me show you how this compares...
>
> [If different needs] That might actually be a better fit for your needs. But if [current property] is right, you wouldn't want to lose it while exploring. The EOI is refundable if you find something better."

## Coach Walkthrough: Closing Scenarios

### Practice Scenario 1: Assumptive Close

**Situation:** After a thorough presentation, the buyer says, "This looks really good. I like everything about it."

**Your task:** Move naturally to the assumptive close without being pushy.

**Focus on:**
- Confident transition
- Natural language
- Clear next step

### Practice Scenario 2: Summary Close

**Situation:** A buyer has been nodding along for 20 minutes but hasn't said "yes" yet. They've agreed the location is perfect, the price is fair, and the developer is reliable.

**Your task:** Use the summary close to gain commitment.

**Focus on:**
- Recapping their agreements
- Building momentum
- Smooth ask for commitment

### Practice Scenario 3: Last-Minute Objection

**Situation:** You're about to send the EOI form when the buyer says, "Actually, I'm not sure. What if property prices crash?"

**Your task:** Handle the objection and return to the close.

**Focus on:**
- Acknowledging the concern
- Providing perspective
- Returning to decision

---

## Closing with Integrity

### What Sets Us Apart

**Traditional sales closing:**
- Push for decision regardless of fit
- Use any technique that works
- Relationship ends after transaction

**Prime Capital closing:**
- Help qualified buyers make good decisions
- Use techniques that serve the buyer
- Relationship continues after purchase

### The Post-Close Moment

**Immediately after commitment:**

> "Excellent choice, [First Name]. I'm genuinely excited for you — this is a strong investment.
>
> Here's what happens now: I'll send over the paperwork within the hour. I'll be with you through every step — the SPA review, completion, and beyond. Welcome to the Prime Capital family."

**Why this matters:**
- Confirms their decision was good (reduces buyer's remorse)
- Sets expectations for ongoing support
- Begins the referral relationship

## Common Closing Mistakes

### What NOT to do:

**1. Closing too early**
> ❌ "So, ready to buy?" (after 5 minutes)

*Problem: Haven't earned the right to ask.*

**2. Never asking**
> ❌ "Let me know when you're ready."

*Problem: Abdicates your responsibility to guide.*

**3. Being apologetic**
> ❌ "I know this is a lot of money, but..."

*Problem: Undermines confidence in the decision.*

**4. Pushy after "no"**
> ❌ "Come on, what's really stopping you?"

*Problem: Damages relationship, creates pressure.*

**5. Not handling objections**
> ❌ "Okay, think about it and get back to me."

*Problem: Leaves them alone with their doubts.*

### What TO do:

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Closing before discovery | Close after thorough needs analysis |
| Waiting for them to close themselves | Confidently guide the decision |
| Apologising for asking | Ask with conviction |
| Pushing after clear no | Explore the objection |
| Abandoning at objection | Address and return to close |
