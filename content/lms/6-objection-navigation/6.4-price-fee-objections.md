# Price & Fee Objections

## Introduction

"Your commission is too high." "There are hidden fees." "I found the same property cheaper elsewhere."

Price and fee objections touch on a sensitive area: money. They can feel personal—like an attack on your value or integrity. They're not. They're investors doing what sophisticated investors do: understanding costs, seeking value, negotiating.

Your role is to respond with transparency, not defensiveness. Prime Capital's positioning—expertise without the hustle—requires us to be clear about costs from the beginning, not defensive when questioned.

## The Core Fear

Behind price objections lies a fear of being taken advantage of: "I'm paying too much, and someone is benefiting at my expense."

This manifests as:
- **Value concern**: "The property isn't worth what they're asking"
- **Commission concern**: "The agent is taking too much"
- **Hidden cost concern**: "There are fees I'm not seeing"
- **Competitive concern**: "I could get a better deal elsewhere"

## The Trust Context

International investors approach Dubai with pre-existing scepticism about fees. They've heard stories—some true—about:
- Agents pushing higher-priced properties for larger commissions
- Undisclosed fees appearing at closing
- Different prices quoted to different buyers
- Commission being loaded into property prices

Your transparency in addressing these concerns either confirms or contradicts their scepticism. Be proactive.

## Common Objections and Responses

### "Your commission seems high."

**What they're really asking:** Am I paying for value, or am I being overcharged?

**Exploration questions:**
- "What commission rate were you expecting?"
- "Have you worked with agents in Dubai before?"
- "What would help you understand the value you're receiving?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Let me be completely transparent about how commissions work.

For off-plan purchases, the developer pays the commission—typically 5-7% of the property price. This comes from the developer's marketing budget, not added to your price. Whether you buy through us or directly from the developer's sales office, your price is the same.

For secondary market (resale) purchases, commissions are typically split between buyer and seller agents, with buyers paying 2%. This is negotiated and disclosed upfront.

Our commission reflects the service we provide:
- Market research and shortlisting
- Developer due diligence
- Transaction management through to handover
- Post-completion support
- Relationship for future transactions

If you're comparing to other agents, I'd encourage you to compare the full service, not just the rate. What support are you receiving throughout the process? What happens after the sale closes?"

---

### "I can buy directly from the developer and save the commission."

**What they're really asking:** Why should I pay you when I can go direct?

**Exploration questions:**
- "Have you spoken directly with the developer?"
- "What's your understanding of how developer pricing works?"
- "Is there a specific project you're considering?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"This is a common misconception, and I want to clear it up.

Developer prices are fixed. Whether you walk into their sales gallery or work with us, you pay the same price. The commission we earn comes from the developer's budget—it's not added to your purchase price.

What you would save by going direct is zero. What you would lose is:
- Independent advice (the developer's salesperson represents the developer, not you)
- Comparative analysis (they'll only show you their projects)
- Transaction support (their job ends at the sale; ours continues through handover)
- Future relationship (they've moved on to the next buyer)

Some investors prefer going direct, and that's their choice. But it's not a financial saving—it's a service tradeoff."

### "There seem to be a lot of hidden fees."

**What they're really asking:** What am I not seeing?

**Exploration questions:**
- "What have you heard about fees in Dubai?"
- "Would a complete cost breakdown be helpful?"
- "Are there specific fees you're concerned about?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Let me give you a complete picture of all costs involved. Nothing hidden.

**Purchase costs:**
- Property price: [amount]
- DLD registration: 4% of property price
- Admin fee: AED 4,000 (DLD processing)
- Agent commission: [structure—developer paid or buyer paid depending on transaction type]
- Trustee fee: ~AED 4,000 (for registration at DLD)

**For mortgages (if applicable):**
- Mortgage registration: 0.25% of loan amount
- Bank arrangement fee: typically 1% of loan amount
- Valuation fee: AED 2,500-3,500

**Ongoing costs:**
- Service charges: [range for property type] per sq ft annually
- DEWA deposit: AED 2,000-4,000

**For off-plan:**
- Oqood registration: 4% (interim registration)
- Final title deed: included in DLD fee upon completion

I can prepare a detailed cost sheet for any property you're considering. You'll know exactly what you're paying before you commit."

### "I found a cheaper option online / with another agent."

**What they're really asking:** Why should I pay more with you?

**Exploration questions:**
- "Can you tell me more about what you found?"
- "Is it the same unit, or a comparable one?"
- "What service is included?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Let's look at that together. In my experience, price differences usually come down to one of three things:

**Different inventory:**
What looks like the same property online might be a different floor, view, or unit type. A 2-bedroom on floor 10 and floor 40 can vary significantly in price.

**Different transaction structures:**
Some agents quote net prices without DLD fees. Others quote gross including everything. Let's make sure we're comparing apples to apples.

**Different service levels:**
Lower-commission agents exist. The question is what you're receiving for that saving. Are they supporting the full transaction? Who handles handover? What happens if issues arise?

If you've found a genuinely better deal for the same property and same service, you should take it. I'm not here to compete on price alone—I'm here to provide value that justifies our fee. If that value doesn't make sense for you, I'd rather you work with someone who fits your needs."

---

### "The property seems overpriced."

**What they're really asking:** Am I getting fair value?

**Exploration questions:**
- "What are you comparing it to?"
- "Is this about absolute price or price per square foot?"
- "What would fair value look like to you?"

**Evidence-based response:**

"Let me understand what's driving that feeling.

If we're comparing to other Dubai properties:
- Same area? Prices vary significantly between communities
- Same developer? Premium developers command premium prices
- Same specifications? Finishes, views, and amenities affect value
- Same timing? Off-plan vs ready pricing differs

If we're comparing to other markets:
- Dubai's price per square foot is lower than London, Singapore, Hong Kong, and most major global cities
- Rental yields (5-8%) are higher than most mature markets
- Zero property tax changes the total cost equation

If there's a specific property you feel is better value, let's look at it together. I'd rather help you find the right property than convince you about the wrong one."

## Coach Walkthrough

### Scenario: The Fee Hunter

**Setup:** An investor has been asking detailed questions about every fee component for the third time.

**Investor says:** "I just want to make sure I understand all the costs. Can you walk me through the fees again?"

**Strong response:**

*Recognise this may be anxiety, not accusation.*

"Of course. Let me prepare something that might be more useful.

I'll create a detailed written breakdown of every cost—purchase fees, registration fees, ongoing costs—specific to the property you're considering. You can review it at your pace, share it with your advisors if you have them, and come back with any questions.

Would that be helpful? I'd rather you have complete clarity in writing than feel uncertain after our conversations."

*If they persist with verbal repetition:*

"I sense there's something specific you're not comfortable with. Can you tell me what's really on your mind? If there's a particular concern, I'd rather address it directly than keep reviewing the same figures."

**Why this works:**
- Offers written documentation for thorough review
- Invites them to share underlying concern
- Doesn't become defensive about repeated questions

---

### Scenario: Commission Negotiation

**Setup:** An investor is trying to negotiate commission down.

**Investor says:** "I've spoken with other agents who charge less. Can you match their rate?"

**Strong response:**

"I appreciate you being direct about this.

I won't match lower rates, and here's why:

Our commission reflects a specific level of service—market research, due diligence, transaction support, post-completion assistance. Reducing the rate would mean reducing the service, and that's not what we offer.

For off-plan, the commission is paid by the developer. Your price is fixed regardless of our commission structure—the developer isn't going to reduce your price if we take less.

For secondary purchases, our 2% fee is market standard. Some agents charge less; some charge more. The question is what you're receiving for that fee.

If the agents you've spoken with offer a service level that meets your needs at a lower price, that might be the right choice for you. I'd just encourage you to understand exactly what's included before committing.

What would help you make this decision?"

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't engage in rate competition
- Explains the reasoning
- Positions service value, not price
- Respects their autonomy to choose
