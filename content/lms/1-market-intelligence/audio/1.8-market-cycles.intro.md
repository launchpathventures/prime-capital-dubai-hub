Welcome to Module 1.8: Golden Visa and Residency. For international investors, the residency component often adds as much value as the property itself. Understand this program thoroughly—it frequently tips decisions.

Here are the essentials:

First, know the threshold. 2 million dirhams in completed property value qualifies for a 10-year renewable residency visa. The property must be handed over—off-plan does not qualify until completion.

Second, understand the benefits. No sponsor required. 100% business ownership in mainland UAE. Family sponsorship included. No minimum stay requirement. Full work and study rights.

Third, clarify common misconceptions. Eligibility is based on property value, not purchase price—RERA valuation confirms this. Multiple properties can be combined. Married couples can both obtain visas on jointly owned property.

Fourth, separate residency from tax residency. The visa provides immigration status, not automatic tax status. Clients should consult tax professionals about their specific situations.

Your key takeaway: The Golden Visa often tips the decision for international buyers. Know it thoroughly, communicate it clearly, and never oversell what it does and does not provide.
