# Off-Plan Evaluation

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **evaluate any off-plan opportunity** using the Developer Due Diligence Checklist and benchmark prices against area data — enabling you to advise clients on risk-adjusted value.

## What Off-Plan Means

Off-plan properties are purchased before construction is complete — sometimes before construction has started. The investor commits capital based on plans, renders, and promises rather than a finished product.

Off-plan can offer attractive entry prices and payment terms. It also carries risks that don't exist with ready properties.

## Why Investors Choose Off-Plan

**Advantages:**

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lower entry price | Developers offer early-bird pricing to fund construction |
| Extended payment plans | Spread payments over construction period (2-4 years) |
| Capital appreciation | Price typically increases from launch to handover |
| Customisation | Sometimes possible to select finishes or make changes |
| Portfolio access | New developments may offer unit types not available in secondary |

**The key question:** Do these advantages outweigh the risks for this specific investor?

## Price Per Sqft Benchmarking by Area

Before evaluating any off-plan, check the price per sqft against area benchmarks:

### Current Market Benchmarks (Q4 2024)

| Area Segment | Areas Included | Ready Range (AED/sqft) | Off-Plan Launch (AED/sqft) |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Entry-Level** | International City, Discovery Gardens, DSO | 650-900 | 750-950 |
| **Affordable** | JVC, JVT, Al Furjan, Arjan | 900-1,200 | 1,000-1,400 |
| **Mid-Market** | Business Bay, JLT, Dubai Hills | 1,300-1,800 | 1,400-1,900 |
| **Premium** | Dubai Marina, Downtown | 1,800-2,600 | 2,000-3,000 |
| **Ultra-Premium** | Palm Jumeirah, DIFC | 2,500-4,500 | 3,000-5,500 |
| **Super-Prime** | Emirates Hills, Jumeirah Bay | 4,000-8,000+ | 5,000-10,000+ |

### Off-Plan Launch Premium Calculator

Off-plan typically launches 10-25% below expected completion value. If a developer is launching near or above ready prices, the upside is limited.

**Example Analysis:**

| Factor | Property A | Property B |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Location | Dubai Marina | Creek Harbour |
| Launch price | AED 2,400/sqft | AED 1,800/sqft |
| Ready comparables | AED 2,500/sqft | AED 2,200/sqft |
| Launch discount | 4% | 18% |
| **Assessment** | Limited upside | Good entry point |

**Rule of thumb:** A healthy off-plan launch should be 15-25% below ready comparables in the same area. Less than 10% below? The developer is pricing in the appreciation already.

## The Developer Due Diligence Checklist

Use this checklist before recommending ANY off-plan property:

### Section A: Developer Profile

- [ ] **RERA registration confirmed** — Verify on DLD website (mandatory)
- [ ] **Years operating in Dubai** — Minimum 5 years preferred
- [ ] **Completed projects** — At least 3 delivered projects in Dubai
- [ ] **Delivery track record** — Average delay less than 12 months
- [ ] **Financial stability** — No recent negative press or restructuring
- [ ] **Listed/backed status** — Publicly listed or backed by sovereign wealth = lower risk

### Section B: Project Specifics

- [ ] **Escrow account registered** — Funds protected per UAE law
- [ ] **Construction status** — Ground broken, enabling works, or still approvals pending?
- [ ] **Completion timeline** — Realistic based on current stage?
- [ ] **Payment plan structure** — Is the majority during or post-construction?
- [ ] **Cancellation terms** — What happens if you need to exit?
- [ ] **Price vs comparables** — Benchmarked against area price per sqft

### Section C: Quality Indicators

- [ ] **Visit completed project** — Same developer, similar segment
- [ ] **Review specifications** — Appliances, finishes, flooring brands specified
- [ ] **Service charge estimate** — Often higher in new buildings; verify
- [ ] **Community amenities** — What's actually included vs masterplan marketing
- [ ] **Handover condition** — Furnished, unfurnished, shell and core?

### Section D: Location Assessment

- [ ] **Infrastructure timeline** — Metro, roads, retail — when will they be delivered?
- [ ] **Comparable ready properties** — What do completed units in the area rent for?
- [ ] **Area development stage** — Established, emerging, or masterplan only?
- [ ] **Distance to demand drivers** — How far to business districts, beach, airport?

## The Developer Scorecard

Rate each developer out of 10 in these categories:

| Criterion | Questions to Answer | Weight |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Track Record** | Projects completed, delivery history | 30% |
| **Quality Reputation** | Owner satisfaction, finish quality | 25% |
| **Financial Strength** | Balance sheet, backing, public listing | 20% |
| **Market Position** | Brand recognition, resale liquidity | 15% |
| **Customer Service** | Communication, issue resolution | 10% |

### Developer Tier Classification

| Tier | Examples | Score Range | Risk Level |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | Emaar, Dubai Properties, Meraas | 8-10 | Low |
| **Tier 2** | Damac, Nakheel, Sobha, Ellington | 6-8 | Low-Medium |
| **Tier 3** | Binghatti, Danube, Azizi | 5-7 | Medium |
| **Tier 4** | New/smaller developers | 3-6 | Medium-High |
| **Unknown** | First project, no track record | N/A | High |

### Sample Developer Evaluation

**Developer: Sobha Realty**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Track Record | 8/10 | Multiple delivered projects, known for Sobha Hartland |
| Quality | 9/10 | Premium finishes, strong owner reviews |
| Financial | 7/10 | Solid but not publicly listed in UAE |
| Market Position | 8/10 | Strong resale demand, recognised brand |
| Customer Service | 7/10 | Generally responsive, some handover delays reported |
| **Weighted Score** | **7.9/10** | **Tier 2 — Low-Medium Risk** |

## The Off-Plan Risk Matrix

Match investor risk tolerance to appropriate off-plan opportunities:

| Investor Profile | Developer Tier | Payment Plan | Area Type | Timeline |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Conservative** | Tier 1 only | 60/40 or 70/30 | Established | 18 months max |
| **Moderate** | Tier 1-2 | 60/40 to 50/50 | Established or Emerging | 2-3 years |
| **Growth-focused** | Tier 1-3 | Any | Emerging acceptable | Up to 4 years |

### Risk-Reward Trade-offs

| Risk Factor | Lower Risk Choice | Higher Risk Choice |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Developer | Tier 1 (Emaar, Meraas) | Tier 3-4 (Newer developers) |
| Construction stage | 50%+ complete | Pre-construction |
| Area | Established (Marina, Downtown) | Emerging (Dubai South, MBR City) |
| Payment | 60% during construction | 90% on completion |
| Timeline | Under 18 months | 3+ years |

## The Core Risks

Understanding what can go wrong helps you advise clients appropriately:

### 1. Developer Risk

Not all developers are equal. Some have impeccable track records. Others have histories of delays, quality issues, or worse.

**Red flags:**
- First project in Dubai (no track record to evaluate)
- History of significant delays (18+ months)
- Quality complaints in completed projects
- Financial difficulties or ownership changes
- Not registered with RERA

### 2. Completion Risk

The property may be delayed. Construction may take longer than promised. In extreme cases, projects are cancelled.

**Mitigation:**
- RERA escrow accounts protect buyer funds
- Choose developers with consistent delivery records (use the Scorecard)
- Understand the current construction stage

### 3. Market Risk

The market may change between purchase and completion. Values could fall, or rental demand could shift.

**Consideration:**
- Off-plan commitments are typically 2-4 years
- The investor must be comfortable with market uncertainty
- Ready properties eliminate this timing risk

### 4. Specification Risk

The finished product may differ from what was shown. Renders are marketing materials, not photographs.

**Mitigation:**
- Review specifications carefully (not just images)
- Visit the developer's completed projects
- Understand what's included vs. optional

## Evaluating Payment Plans (Preview)

Off-plan payment plans vary significantly. Common structures:

| Structure | Description | Investor Profile |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 60/40 | 60% during construction, 40% on handover | Balanced approach |
| 80/20 | 80% during construction, 20% on handover | Lower cash on handover |
| 40/60 | 40% during construction, 60% post-handover | Lower upfront commitment |
| 10/90 | 10% deposit, 90% on completion | Maximum leverage |

Module 4.4 covers payment plan analysis in detail.

## How to Present Off-Plan to Investors

### Frame the Trade-offs

**Don't say:** "This is a great opportunity — you'll make money when it completes."

**Do say:** "Off-plan offers a lower entry point and extended payments, but you're committing capital 3 years before you can rent the property. Let me share what I've found on this developer's track record."

### Be Honest About Unknowns

**Don't say:** "The area will definitely develop by handover."

**Do say:** "The masterplan shows retail and a metro station by 2027. Based on similar developments, infrastructure often arrives 12-18 months after residential handover. That affects initial rental demand."

### Present Developer Evidence

When recommending an off-plan property, share specific due diligence:

"I've evaluated this developer across four criteria:

1. **Track record:** They've completed 8 projects in Dubai since 2015. Average delay has been 6 months — below the industry average.

2. **Quality:** I visited their Marina project from 2021. Finish quality is good, and the building is well-maintained.

3. **Financial stability:** Publicly listed, consistent revenue growth, no restructuring.

4. **This project:** Construction is at Level 12 of 35. Escrow account is registered. Completion target is Q2 2026."

## When to Recommend Ready vs. Off-Plan

| Investor Profile | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Needs rental income immediately | Ready |
| Has limited capital, wants entry | Off-plan (extended payment) |
| Risk-averse, first Dubai purchase | Ready |
| Comfortable with 3-year horizon | Either |
| Specific unit type unavailable ready | Off-plan |
| Concerned about current market values | Off-plan (potential discount) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Benchmark prices first** — Check launch price against area price per sqft
2. **Use the Developer Scorecard** — Tier 1-4 classification for every recommendation
3. **Complete the Due Diligence Checklist** — All sections before any off-plan recommendation
4. **Match risk to investor** — Use the Off-Plan Risk Matrix
5. **Delays are common** — Plan for 6-12 months beyond target
6. **Renders aren't reality** — Visit completed projects by same developer
7. **Be honest about risks** — Never oversell off-plan certainty
