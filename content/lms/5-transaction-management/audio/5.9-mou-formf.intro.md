Form F is legally binding the moment both parties sign. That ten percent deposit isn't a holding fee—it's at risk. Mistakes in this document—wrong names, vague conditions, unclear terms—create disputes that can derail transactions and destroy relationships.

Here's what precision looks like.

First, names must match exactly. Buyer name as it appears on passport. Seller name as it appears on title deed. One spelling difference creates problems at DLD transfer. Verify against original documents, not memory.

Second, conditions precedent must be specific. "Subject to financing" isn't good enough. "Subject to buyer obtaining mortgage pre-approval of minimum AED 1.5 million within fourteen days" is clear. Vague conditions create arguments about whether they've been satisfied.

Third, deposits go to conveyancing offices, never to agents or individuals. This isn't just best practice—it's legal protection for everyone. Deposit disputes with proper trustees follow documented procedures. Deposits held improperly create nightmares.

Fourth, completion timelines must be realistic. Account for NOC processing, mortgage approval, all parties' availability. Aggressive timelines that can't be met create extension conflicts and potential defaults.

The key takeaway: Form F is the foundation of secondary transactions. Accuracy here prevents problems throughout the process. Rush through it with errors, and you'll spend weeks fixing preventable issues while your client questions your competence.
