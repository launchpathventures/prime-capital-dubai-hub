### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

First-time off-plan buyers have one overwhelming fear: what if the developer takes my money and doesn't build? In Dubai's early real estate days, this happened. The escrow system was designed specifically to prevent it—and your ability to explain escrow clearly builds enormous client confidence.

Here's what you must know.

First, buyer funds don't go to developers directly. They go to a regulated bank account managed by an escrow agent. The developer can only access money as they prove construction progress. No building, no funds.

Second, releases are milestone-linked and verified. An independent engineer certifies construction has reached each stage before the bank releases corresponding funds. Multiple parties check the system—it's not trust-based.

Third, if the worst happens—developer bankruptcy—escrow funds are protected. Buyers have priority claim over general creditors. The government may assign projects to other developers for completion. There's a safety net.

Fourth, verification matters. Before recommending any off-plan purchase, confirm the project has a registered escrow account. Verify payment instructions specify escrow. Any request for payment outside escrow is a serious red flag.

The key takeaway: Escrow is one of Dubai's strongest buyer protections, but only if clients understand it. When you explain clearly how their money is held, how releases work, and what happens if problems arise, you transform nervous prospects into confident buyers.
