Before Oqood existed, off-plan buyers had nothing but a developer's word that their unit wouldn't be sold to someone else. People lost money. Trust in the market suffered. Oqood changed that—and you need to understand exactly how it protects your clients.

Here's what matters.

First, Oqood registration creates an official government record of your client's purchase. The Dubai Land Department tracks it. The unit cannot be sold to another party while registered. This isn't just paperwork—it's legal protection.

Second, the DLD four percent registration fee is paid by the buyer. This is the standard practice. However, some developers offer to cover this fee as a promotional incentive. Always confirm the fee arrangement with the developer before advising clients—don't assume the standard applies.

Third, registration typically takes thirty to sixty days after SPA signing. Developers handle the process, but you track it. Follow up at two weeks, four weeks, six weeks if needed. Clients shouldn't have to wonder about status.

Fourth, Oqood is required for mortgage financing. Banks won't lend against off-plan property without it. If your client might need financing before handover, they need Oqood complete.

Fifth, verify the certificate when it arrives. Names must match passport exactly. Unit details must be accurate. Errors caught now are fixed easily. Errors discovered at title deed stage cause delays and expense.

The key takeaway: Oqood transforms a private contract into a government-recognized ownership interest. Buyer pays the DLD fee unless the developer offers a promotion. Track registration actively, verify the certificate thoroughly, and make sure clients understand why this step matters.
