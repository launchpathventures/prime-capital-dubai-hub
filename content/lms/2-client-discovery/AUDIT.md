## WARNING Issues

### ⚠️ Issue 1: Limited Persona Diversity in Examples

**Finding**: While the personas framework (2.1) mentions all target client groups, the dialogue examples across modules show limited diversity:

**Representation in Coach Walkthroughs**:
- ✅ British/UK expats: Strong (2.2 - Sarah and James)
- ✅ Indian HNWI: Strong (2.4 - Raj, 2.5 - Priya)
- ✅ Singapore-based: Strong (2.3 - Michael)
- ✅ GCC nationals: Adequate (2.7 - Ahmed, Saudi)
- ❌ Chinese business owners: **Not represented**
- ❌ Russian investors: **Not represented**

**Recommendation**: Future content iterations could add:
- Chinese investor example in market comparison context
- Russian HNWI example in wealth preservation context
- More GCC national examples showing regional investment patterns

**Severity**: LOW - The fundamental discovery frameworks are culturally neutral and applicable to all client types. The missing personas don't impact learning effectiveness.

---

### ⚠️ Issue 2: Cultural Sensitivity - All Examples Appropriate

**Finding**: All client examples in the competency demonstrate cultural sensitivity:

✅ **Appropriate representations**:
- Indian clients shown as sophisticated tech entrepreneurs and investors (not stereotyped)
- British clients shown as family-focused relocators (common Dubai demographic)
- Singapore clients shown as experienced investors (reflects reality)
- Saudi client shown as business-savvy but needing expectation management (realistic)

✅ **Language and tone**:
- No stereotypical names or characterizations
- Professional dialogue that respects all cultures
- Examples reflect actual Prime Capital client base
- No problematic assumptions about any nationality

**Severity**: NONE - This is validation that content IS culturally sensitive

---

## Talk Track Quality Assessment

All Skills+Script modules (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7) were evaluated for dialogue naturalness:

### Text-to-Speech Readability: ✅ EXCELLENT

2. **Appropriate pacing**: Sentences are well-structured for TTS
3. **Natural transitions**: Questions flow logically into responses
4. **Professional tone**: Maintains "quiet luxury" brand voice
5. **Clear speak tags**: All Coach Walkthroughs now properly tagged

**Specific Examples**:
- "That's exciting—congratulations on the opportunity" (2.2) - Natural enthusiasm
- "That skepticism is healthy" (2.3) - Builds rapport without being salesy
- "Let me be honest with you, David" (2.6) - Professional directness
- "I want to give you the complete picture" (2.7) - Transparent and trustworthy

**TTS Recommendation**: All dialogue is ready for text-to-speech conversion without modification
