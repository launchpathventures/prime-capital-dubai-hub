questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What is the core fear behind most market objections?"
    options:
      - text: "The investor doesn't trust you"
        correct: false
      - text: "The investor will lose money"
        correct: true
      - text: "The investor doesn't understand the market"
        correct: false
      - text: "The investor wants a better deal"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Behind every market objection lies a single fear: 'I'll lose money.' This manifests as bubble concerns, timing hesitation, volatility worry, or global uncertainty."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When an investor asks 'Is Dubai in a bubble?', what structural difference between today's market and 2008 should you highlight?"
    options:
      - text: "Prices are higher today than in 2008"
        correct: false
      - text: "More international buyers are active today"
        correct: false
      - text: "RERA now requires developers to hold funds in escrow"
        correct: true
      - text: "Interest rates are lower today"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Key structural differences include RERA escrow requirements, regulated mortgage lending (50% LTV for non-residents), and transaction fees that discourage speculation. These address the systemic issues that caused the 2008 crash."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "How should you respond when an investor says 'I'll wait for prices to drop'?"
    options:
      - text: "Tell them prices are about to rise imminently"
        correct: false
      - text: "Explain the cost of waiting (rental income foregone, potential appreciation missed)"
        correct: true
      - text: "Agree that waiting is a good strategy"
        correct: false
      - text: "Challenge them to prove prices will drop"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Rather than creating false urgency, help investors understand the opportunity cost of waiting—foregone rental income, missed appreciation, delayed residency benefits—while respecting their autonomy."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What might be the real issue when an investor repeatedly finds reasons to wait (18+ months)?"
    options:
      - text: "They're very careful decision makers"
        correct: false
      - text: "Property investment may not be right for them"
        correct: true
      - text: "They're waiting for a specific price point"
        correct: false
      - text: "They need more information"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If someone is always finding reasons to wait, the reason might not be the market—it might be that property investment doesn't feel right for them. Naming this pattern opens space for honest conversation."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When addressing global economic uncertainty concerns, what should you emphasise about Dubai?"
    options:
      - text: "Dubai is completely immune to global economic factors"
        correct: false
      - text: "Dubai has demonstrated resilience and may provide portfolio diversification"
        correct: true
      - text: "Global factors have never affected Dubai's property market"
        correct: false
      - text: "Investors should only focus on Dubai, not global conditions"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Dubai isn't immune to global factors, but has shown resilience. More importantly, Dubai real estate may provide portfolio diversification from Western-correlated investments. Honest acknowledgment of risk builds credibility."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the best approach when an investor compares current prices to 2014's previous peak?"
    options:
      - text: "Dismiss the comparison as irrelevant"
        correct: false
      - text: "Explain that peak-to-peak comparison isn't the only metric; infrastructure, buyer composition, and global comparison have evolved"
        correct: true
      - text: "Agree that prices are too high right now"
        correct: false
      - text: "Encourage them to wait for a correction"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Price-to-previous-peak is one metric, but not the only one. Infrastructure has transformed, buyer composition has shifted to more end-users, and Dubai is more affordable than other global cities. The investment case matters more than peak comparison."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the key difference between sentiment and structure when addressing market concerns?"
    options:
      - text: "Sentiment is more important for investment decisions"
        correct: false
      - text: "Structure refers to regulations and market mechanics that protect buyers"
        correct: true
      - text: "Both are unreliable indicators of market health"
        correct: false
      - text: "Sentiment drives prices; structure is irrelevant"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Sentiment can be misleading in both directions—it was deeply negative post-2020 but proved wrong. Structure (escrow requirements, mortgage regulations, transaction costs) provides more reliable indicators of market stability."

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "How should you handle an investor who says 'everyone seems bullish, which worries me'?"
    options:
      - text: "Tell them they're wrong to be contrarian"
        correct: false
      - text: "Acknowledge contrarian thinking has value, then pivot to structural analysis"
        correct: true
      - text: "Agree that the market is probably overheated"
        correct: false
      - text: "Dismiss their concern as uninformed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Acknowledging that contrarian thinking has value respects their intelligence. Then pivot to what matters more than sentiment: the structural framework (RERA escrow, mortgage regulations, transaction costs) that differs from 2008."
