TYPE: skills

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Welcome to Comparative Market Analysis — where you'll learn to structure property comparisons that help investors decide confidently.

Investors rarely buy the first property they see. They want to understand options, weigh trade-offs, and feel confident they've considered alternatives. Comparative market analysis — CMA — structures this comparison.

In this module, you'll learn a five-step framework. Define comparison criteria based on investor requirements. Gather data consistently for each property. Build a comparison matrix that puts options side by side. Highlight trade-offs with clear analysis. And facilitate the decision without dictating it.

You'll also learn when to recommend against all options. Sometimes the honest answer is "none of these is right." Recommending against a transaction protects your credibility far more than forcing a poor fit.

By the end, you'll move the conversation from "Is this a good property?" to "Which property best fits my requirements?" — and sometimes to "We should wait for better options."

Let's get into the framework.

### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

**CONTEXT**

You'll use comparative analysis whenever an investor is evaluating multiple properties. It's the tool that transforms scattered options into a clear decision framework. Done well, it demonstrates expertise. Done poorly — or skipped entirely — it leaves investors confused and uncommitted.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through the five-step framework.

Step one: define comparison criteria. Before comparing properties, agree on what matters. Use the investor's stated requirements as your guide. Financial criteria include price, price per square foot, gross yield, net yield. Location criteria include area, proximity to metro or beach, established versus emerging. Property criteria include size, layout, view, floor level, condition. Building criteria include developer, age, service charges, amenities. Risk criteria include ready versus off-plan, developer track record, payment terms. And liquidity criteria include rental demand and resale potential.

Here's the key: not all criteria matter equally. An investor focused on rental income cares more about yield than view. An investor planning to use the property cares more about view than yield. Weight criteria based on what they've told you.

Step two: gather data consistently. For fair comparison, you need the same data points for each property. Address and unit details. Exact size from title deed or floor plan — not estimates. Purchase price. Payment terms if off-plan. Service charges — exact annual figures. Current or expected rent. Completion status or date. Developer name and track record. Building age and condition.

Avoid comparing properties with unequal information. If one property has researched data and another has estimates, the comparison is unfair and misleading.

Step three: build the comparison matrix. A comparison matrix puts properties side by side against the criteria. Create a table with properties as columns and criteria as rows. Price, price per square foot, size, bedrooms, view, floor, status, gross yield, net yield, service charge per foot, developer, building age, resale liquidity.

The matrix shows facts at a glance. An investor can immediately see which property is cheapest, which has the highest yield, which is newest.

Step four: highlight trade-offs. The matrix shows data. Your analysis explains what it means.

For example: "Property A is the balanced option — premium location, sea view, established building with proven rental history. You're paying three fifty thousand more than Property B for stronger resale potential. Property B is the yield play — best net return at four point nine percent, lowest entry cost, lowest service charges. The trade-off is location prestige. Property C is the growth play — flagship location, Emaar quality, but off-plan with eighteen months to completion. No rental income until twenty-twenty-six, and yields are projected not proven."

This is where your expertise shows. Anyone can build a table. The value is in interpreting what the numbers mean for this investor.

Step five: facilitate the decision. Your job isn't to decide for the investor. It's to help them decide confidently. Ask clarifying questions: "Which of these factors matters most to you?" "Is rental yield more important than location?" "How do you feel about waiting eighteen months?"

When they're stuck, reframe: "Rather than choosing the best property — because there isn't one — think about what you'd regret. Would you regret paying more for the Marina sea view? Or would you regret not taking the JLT yield when you had the chance?"

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, comparing too many properties. More than four or five creates decision paralysis. Filter to a shortlist before presenting.

Second, unequal information. Don't compare researched data against estimates. Get consistent data for all options.

Third, hiding weaknesses. If one property has a clear drawback, state it. Concealing it damages credibility when the investor discovers it.

**PRO TIP**

Know when to recommend against all options. Sometimes the honest answer is: none of these is right. "Based on what you're looking for, I don't think any of these three hit the mark. The yields don't justify the prices in this market. I'd recommend we wait for new inventory next month." Recommending against a transaction protects your credibility. Investors remember advisors who told them to wait.
