MODULE 3.1: Off-Plan Lead Sources
TYPE: knowledge
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Not all leads are equal — and understanding where they come from is the first step to converting them.

In this module, you'll learn the lead source hierarchy. We break sources into three tiers based on intent level. Tier one includes property portals, direct website enquiries, and referrals — these require a sixty-second response window. Tier two covers developer launch registrations, social media enquiries, and email marketing responses — you have up to two hours here. Tier three is your cold sources: exhibition leads and purchased lists — these need qualification before investing serious time.

You'll also learn the BANT framework adapted for off-plan sales: Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. Within the first two minutes of any conversation, you should know if someone can actually buy.

Here's a key statistic: leads contacted within sixty seconds convert three times better than those contacted after five minutes. After thirty minutes, you're already competing against agents who were faster.

Remember: referral leads close at four times the rate of portal leads. Every completed transaction is an opportunity to earn your next one.

Let's dive into lead sources and build your prioritisation system.
