## The Mortgage Process

### Timeline Overview

| Stage | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Pre-approval | 3-7 days | Initial assessment, indicative terms |
| Valuation | 3-7 days | Property assessment |
| Final approval | 7-14 days | Documentation review, underwriting |
| Disbursement | 1-3 days | Funds transferred |

**Total Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (can be longer for complex cases)

### Stage 1: Pre-Approval

**What Happens:**
- Client submits initial documents
- Bank assesses eligibility
- Indicative loan amount provided
- Not a guarantee—subject to valuation and final approval

**Your Role:**
- Connect client with mortgage broker or bank
- Ensure client understands documents needed
- Track pre-approval status

**Why Pre-Approval First:**
- Prevents client committing to property they can't finance
- Identifies potential issues early
- Speeds up final approval once property selected

### Stage 2: Valuation

**What Happens:**
- Bank orders independent valuation
- Valuator inspects property (secondary) or reviews details (off-plan)
- Valuation report submitted to bank
- Bank may lend less if valuation below purchase price

**Your Role:**
- Facilitate property access for valuation (secondary)
- Provide developer/project information (off-plan)
- Alert client if valuation gap exists

**Valuation Gap:**
If property valued lower than purchase price, client must:
- Pay the difference in cash, OR
- Renegotiate purchase price, OR
- Seek alternative financing

### Stage 3: Final Approval

**What Happens:**
- Bank reviews all documentation
- Credit assessment completed
- Loan committee approval
- Final offer letter issued

**Your Role:**
- Ensure all documents submitted
- Follow up on outstanding requirements
- Track approval timeline
- Keep transaction parties informed

### Stage 4: Disbursement

**What Happens:**
- Client signs mortgage documents
- Bank issues manager's cheque to seller/developer
- Mortgage registered with DLD
- Funds transferred

**Your Role:**
- Coordinate disbursement with transfer timing
- Ensure cheque payee details correct
- Confirm funds received before proceeding

## Working with Mortgage Brokers

### Why Use Brokers

**Benefits:**
- Access to multiple banks
- Expertise in documentation requirements
- Better rates through volume relationships
- Handle paperwork and follow-up
- No cost to buyer (paid by bank)

**Prime Capital Practice:**
We partner with reputable mortgage brokers and recommend their services to clients requiring financing.

### Broker Coordination

**Your Role:**
1. **Refer client** to broker early in process
2. **Share transaction details** — property, price, timeline
3. **Facilitate communication** — connect broker with developer if needed
4. **Align timelines** — mortgage approval before transfer date
5. **Track progress** — follow up on status regularly

### Choosing a Broker

**Look For:**
- Licensed and registered
- Multiple bank relationships
- Track record with similar transactions
- Responsive communication
- Clear fee disclosure (should be zero client cost)

---

## Mortgage Timeline Coordination

### Off-Plan Purchase

**Mortgage Timeline:**
- Pre-approval at any time (even before selecting unit)
- Oqood required for bank security
- Mortgage finalized closer to handover
- Disbursement at handover payment

**Key Dates:**
- Start mortgage process 3-6 months before expected handover
- Final approval needed 2-4 weeks before handover
- Disbursement coordinated with final payment due date

### Secondary Purchase

**Mortgage Timeline:**
- Pre-approval before making offer (ideal)
- Valuation after MOU signing
- Final approval before transfer date
- Disbursement on transfer day

**Key Dates:**
- MOU typically allows 30-60 days to completion
- Mortgage must be approved within that window
- Valuation should be ordered immediately after MOU
- Manager's cheque needed for transfer day

### Timeline Risk Management

**Problem:** Mortgage delay causes missed transfer date

**Prevention:**
- Start mortgage process immediately
- Choose bank with reliable timeline
- Use experienced mortgage broker
- Buffer time in MOU if possible

**If Delay Occurs:**
- Communicate with all parties immediately
- Request transfer date extension
- Provide specific new timeline
- Document reason for delay

---

## Client Mortgage Conversations

### Initial Assessment

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Are you planning to pay cash or use financing?"
- "Do you have a relationship with a UAE bank?"
- "What's your current employment situation?"
- "Have you been pre-approved for a mortgage?"

### Setting Expectations

> "If you're using mortgage financing, I recommend starting the pre-approval process before we select a property. This confirms your budget and speeds up the final process once you've chosen. I can connect you with a mortgage broker who specializes in property financing—there's no cost to you."

### Managing Timeline

> "The mortgage process typically takes 2-4 weeks from application to approval. For a secondary purchase, we'll need final approval before our transfer date. I'll work closely with your mortgage broker to keep everything on track."
