Welcome to Module 1.1: Dubai Real Estate Overview. This is the foundation of your market intelligence—the 30,000-foot view every consultant needs to advise international investors.

Here are the essentials you need to know:

First, market scale. Dubai recorded over 169,000 transactions in 2024, totaling 427 billion dirhams—a 42% increase year-over-year. This is not a speculative bubble. It is institutional-grade demand.

Second, yield advantage. Dubai delivers 6 to 8 percent gross rental yields—roughly double what you would see in London or New York. For investors optimizing returns, this matters.

Third, international demand. 45% of transactions come from international buyers representing over 100 nationalities. Indians, British, Russians, and Chinese lead the buyer demographics.

Fourth, regulatory maturity. The market has transformed since 2008. RERA oversight, mandatory escrow accounts, and clear title deed systems now protect buyers at international standards.

Your key takeaway: Dubai is no longer an emerging market. It is a liquid, regulated, and yield-advantaged destination competing with the world's best. When clients question whether Dubai is "ready," the data answers for you.
