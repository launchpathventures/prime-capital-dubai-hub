## Question 1

What are the four metrics evaluated by The Payment Plan Calculator?

- A) Price, yield, location, developer
- B) Capital deployed, opportunity cost, risk exposure, ROI on deployed capital
- C) Booking, construction, handover, post-handover
- D) Gross yield, net yield, appreciation, total return

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** The Payment Plan Calculator evaluates: Capital Deployed (money committed over time), Opportunity Cost (returns forgone), Risk Exposure (capital at risk if project fails), and ROI on Deployed Capital (return relative to cash invested).

## Question 2

In a 60/40 payment plan, what does "60/40" refer to?

- A) 60% discount on the property, 40% commission
- B) 60% paid during construction, 40% paid on handover
- C) 60% of units sold, 40% remaining
- D) 60-month payment period, 40-month warranty

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** A 60/40 plan means 60% of the property price is paid in instalments during the construction period, and the remaining 40% is paid when the property is handed over to the buyer.

## Question 3

According to the Plan Selector Matrix, which payment plan is best for an investor with limited immediate capital but strong future income?

- A) 80/20 (80% during construction, 20% on handover)
- B) 60/40 (60% during construction, 40% on handover)
- C) 40/60 (40% during construction, 60% post-handover)
- D) Cash purchase

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** A 40/60 plan requires less capital during construction (40%) with the majority (60%) paid post-handover, often in instalments. This suits investors who can pay from future income or rental revenue, though they should expect a price premium.

## Question 4

A property costs AED 2,000,000 on a 60/40 plan and AED 2,100,000 on a 40/60 plan. What is the premium percentage for extended terms?

- A) 2.5%
- B) 5%
- C) 10%
- D) AED 100,000

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Premium = (2,100,000 - 2,000,000) / 2,000,000 × 100 = 5%. The 40/60 plan costs 5% more for the flexibility of lower upfront payments.

## Question 5

On an 80/20 payment plan for a AED 1,500,000 property, how much is due on handover?

- A) AED 150,000
- B) AED 300,000
- C) AED 600,000
- D) AED 1,200,000

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** On an 80/20 plan, 20% is due on handover. 20% of AED 1,500,000 = AED 300,000.

## Question 6

An investor has capital that could earn 6% per year if not invested in property. A 40/60 plan has a 5% premium over a 60/40 plan for a 3-year construction period. Based on opportunity cost calculation, which plan is better?

- A) 40/60 — the flexibility is worth it
- B) 60/40 — the premium costs more than the capital returns
- C) They are equal
- D) Need more information about the specific property

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** At 6% return, the extra preserved capital doesn't generate enough return to offset the 5% premium. The break-even is approximately 10%+ return on capital. At 6%, the 60/40 plan is more cost-effective.

## Question 7

What is the primary purpose of RERA escrow accounts in off-plan transactions?

- A) To hold the consultant's commission until completion
- B) To protect buyer funds until construction milestones are met
- C) To pay the developer's construction costs upfront
- D) To collect service charges in advance

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** RERA escrow accounts protect buyer payments. Funds are held in a regulated account and released to the developer only when construction milestones are achieved. If a project is cancelled, escrow funds are returned to buyers.

## Question 8

An investor says they're concerned about having a large payment due on handover. According to the Plan Selector Matrix, which plan addresses this concern?

- A) 60/40
- B) 80/20
- C) 40/60
- D) 10/90

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** An 80/20 plan means most of the payment (80%) is made during construction, leaving only 20% due on handover. This reduces the final lump sum requirement and gives certainty about the remaining commitment.

---

## Question 9

If a property appreciates 20% during a 3-year construction period, and an investor used a 60/40 plan with AED 1,200,000 at risk during construction, what is the approximate ROI on capital at risk?

- A) 20%
- B) 33%
- C) 50%
- D) Cannot calculate without property price

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** If the property (say AED 2,000,000) appreciates 20%, the gain is AED 400,000. ROI on capital at risk = 400,000 / 1,200,000 × 100 = 33%. This is the leverage effect of payment plans.

## Question 10

When explaining payment plans to an investor, which approach demonstrates best practice according to the module?

- A) Recommend the plan that most buyers choose
- B) Use The Payment Plan Calculator to convert percentages to real AED amounts and show ROI on capital deployed
- C) Always recommend the plan with the lowest handover payment
- D) Focus only on the booking amount since that's the immediate decision

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Best practice is to use The Payment Plan Calculator: convert percentages to real AED amounts, calculate capital deployed over time, show opportunity cost, and present ROI on capital deployed. This helps investors make informed decisions based on their specific situation rather than generic advice.
