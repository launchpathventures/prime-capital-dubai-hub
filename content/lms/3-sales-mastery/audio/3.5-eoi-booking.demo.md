**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of guiding a buyer from interest to EOI commitment. The investor has just seen a presentation and expressed positive interest but hasn't made a decision. Watch how each agent handles the pivotal moment.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: After presentation, agent is eager to close]*

Agent: "So, ready to move forward? I'll send you the EOI form now."

Investor: "I'm interested, but I need some time to think about it."

Agent: "I understand, but honestly this unit will definitely be gone by tomorrow. There's a lot of interest. You really need to decide today."

Investor: "That feels like a lot of pressure..."

Agent: "It's not pressure, it's just the reality. So what do you say? Can I send the EOI?"

Investor: "Look, I'll think about it and let you know."

Agent: "Okay, but don't take too long or you'll miss out."

*[Conversation ends awkwardly, investor feels pushed]*

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Went Wrong**

Four serious errors. First, assuming rather than asking — "I'll send you the EOI form now" presumes a decision they haven't made. Second, fabricated urgency — "will definitely be gone tomorrow" may not be true, and if the investor checks and finds the unit still available, trust is destroyed. Third, dismissing concerns — when the investor said they felt pressured, the agent denied it instead of addressing it. Fourth, no understanding of the objection — "I need time to think" usually means something specific. The agent never asked what they needed to think about.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: After presentation, agent reads the moment]*

Agent: "Based on our conversation, it sounds like this unit at Creek Harbour fits what you're looking for. Would you like me to explain how we'd secure it for you?"

Investor: "Yes, walk me through that."

Agent: "Great. Here's how it works. First, we submit an EOI — an Expression of Interest — for fifty thousand dirhams. This reserves the unit for you while you complete your due diligence.

The EOI is fully refundable within fourteen days if you decide not to proceed. During that time, you can review the SPA, confirm the payment schedule, and do any additional research you need.

If everything checks out, we convert to a formal booking by signing the SPA and paying the booking deposit.

Does that process make sense?"

Investor: "Yes, that's clear. But I think I need more time to think about it."

Agent: "Absolutely — it's a significant decision. What specific aspects do you still need to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

Investor: "Honestly, I want to run the numbers by my accountant before committing any money."

Agent: "That makes complete sense. Here's what I'd suggest: the EOI actually gives you that time to consult your accountant. It holds the unit while you do your due diligence, and it's fully refundable if the numbers don't work.

I want to be transparent: this development has sold seventy percent of units, and this floor plan is popular. I can't guarantee it will be available after the weekend. That's not pressure — it's just how these launches work.

The EOI protects your option while you decide. Without it, you're relying on availability."

Investor: "Okay, that makes sense. Let's do the EOI. I can get it to my accountant this week."

Agent: "Perfect. I'll send the form now. Once it's submitted, let's schedule a call for Thursday to review the SPA together. Does ten AM work?"

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Made It Work**

First, asking permission — "Would you like me to explain how we'd secure it?" invites engagement rather than presuming it. Second, clear explanation — the investor knows exactly what the EOI is, what it costs, and that it's refundable. Third, uncovering the real objection — asking "what specifically do you need to think through" revealed the accountant concern. Fourth, repositioning the EOI — framing it as protection while they decide, not a commitment. And fifth, legitimate urgency — seventy percent sold is a fact, and the agent was honest that they couldn't guarantee availability. Sixth, immediate next step — Thursday call scheduled before the conversation ends.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest difference? The strong example addressed the real objection. "I need to think about it" almost never means "I haven't thought about it." It means there's something specific holding them back. Find that thing, address it, and the path forward becomes clear. The EOI is a tool that solves many objections — it just needs to be positioned as the buyer's safety net, not your closing tactic.
