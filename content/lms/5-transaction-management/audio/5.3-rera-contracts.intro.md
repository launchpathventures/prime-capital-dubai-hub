Clients are trusting you with one of the largest purchases of their lives. If you can't explain what their contract actually says—what protects them, what they're obligated to do, what happens if things go wrong—you're not advising. You're just processing paperwork.

Here's what every consultant must understand.

First, know the RERA form system. Form A is the seller agency agreement. Form B is the buyer contract. Form F is the MOU between buyer and seller. Form I is the agent-to-agent commission split agreement. Each serves a specific purpose in transactions. Official YouTube tutorials walk you through creating each form digitally.

Second, RERA standardized contracts exist to protect all parties. The SPA isn't just developer-friendly legal jargon. It includes buyer protections: escrow requirements, completion deadlines, defects liability. Know these provisions and explain them.

Third, the fourteen-day cooling-off period applies only if the developer has mentioned it in the SPA. Not all SPAs include this provision. Check your specific contract—don't assume it applies. This is a significant protection when available, but verify it's actually in the agreement.

Fourth, escrow isn't a buzzword—it's the mechanism that keeps buyer funds safe. Money goes to a regulated bank account, released to developers only when construction progresses. Your ability to explain this clearly builds enormous trust.

Fifth, Form F for secondary transactions is legally binding the moment both parties sign. That ten percent deposit isn't just commitment money—it's at risk if the buyer doesn't complete. Make sure clients understand the stakes before signing.

The key takeaway: Contracts protect your clients when you understand them. Know the form types, check whether cooling-off provisions actually exist in each SPA, and explain key clauses in plain language. Your knowledge here prevents disputes and builds lifelong client relationships.
