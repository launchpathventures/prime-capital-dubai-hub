Welcome to Yield and ROI Calculations — the numbers that sophisticated investors care about most.

Here's the reality: when an investor asks "What will this property earn me?" — you need to give them a precise, defensible answer. Getting yield calculations wrong destroys credibility instantly. Getting them right positions you as a knowledgeable advisor, not just a salesperson.

In this module, you'll master three calculations. Gross yield — the quick comparison number. Net yield — the realistic income after costs. And total return — the full picture including capital appreciation.

You'll learn to account for service charges, management fees, vacancy allowance, and all the costs that turn an attractive gross yield into a more modest net yield.

Most importantly, you'll learn how to present these numbers transparently. Show your working. Specify whether you're quoting gross or net. Never let an investor assume.

By the end, you'll be able to run the numbers on any property and explain them in investor-friendly terms. That's how you build trust with sophisticated buyers.

Let's get into the calculations.
