# BANT+ Qualification

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **qualify a client's readiness within 5 minutes** using the BANT+ framework, understanding their Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, and Competitive situation—without feeling like an interrogation.

---

## Why Qualification Matters

Time is your most precious resource. Every hour spent with an unqualified client is an hour not spent with someone ready to buy.

But qualification isn't about filtering people out. It's about understanding where they are so you can serve them appropriately. A browsing client might become a buyer in six months. A serious client might need to close next week.

BANT+ helps you understand:
- Can they buy? (Budget)
- Will they decide? (Authority)
- Do they need what we offer? (Need)
- When will they act? (Timeline)
- What else are they considering? (Competition)

This isn't a checklist to run through mechanically. It's a framework for having structured conversations that efficiently qualify while building trust.

## The BANT+ Framework

### B — Budget

**What you need to know:**
- What is their budget range?
- Is there flexibility?
- Cash or financing?
- Where are the funds coming from?

**Why it matters:**
Budget eliminates options. If they have AED 1.5M, showing them AED 3M properties wastes everyone's time. If they need a mortgage, the process is different than cash.

**The nuance:**
Budget isn't always fixed. Some clients have more available than they initially say. Others think they have more than they do. Explore flexibility without being pushy.

### A — Authority

**What you need to know:**
- Who makes the final decision?
- Who else needs to agree?
- Are there advisors involved?
- What's the decision-making process?

**Why it matters:**
Selling to the wrong person means starting over when the real decision-maker appears. Understanding authority lets you involve the right people from the start.

**The nuance:**
Authority is often shared. Both spouses. Business partners. Financial advisors. Map the entire decision-making unit, not just the person on the call.

### N — Need

**What you need to know:**
- What problem are they solving?
- What goals do they have?
- What happens if they don't buy?
- How urgent is the need?

**Why it matters:**
Need creates motivation. A client who "would like" a property is different from one who "needs" it. Understanding the depth of need helps you prioritize.

**The nuance:**
Sometimes the stated need isn't the real need. "I want rental income" might really mean "I want financial security." Dig for the need behind the need.

### T — Timeline

**What you need to know:**
- When do they want to buy?
- What's driving that timeline?
- Are there external deadlines?
- How flexible is the timing?

**Why it matters:**
Timeline determines your process. A client buying next month needs a different approach than one buying next year. Timeline also reveals seriousness—serious buyers have timelines.

**The nuance:**
"Not in a rush" can mean genuinely exploratory, or it can mean hesitant. Probe for what's behind the timing.

### + — Competitive Situation

**What you need to know:**
- Are they talking to other agents?
- Are they looking at other markets?
- What other options are they considering?
- How do they view us versus alternatives?

**Why it matters:**
Knowing the competition lets you position effectively. If they're comparing Dubai to Portugal, you can address the comparison directly. If they're talking to five agents, you need to differentiate.

**The nuance:**
Clients often don't volunteer competitive information. Ask directly but not defensively.

## The 5-Minute Qualifier

The 5-Minute Qualifier is a structured approach to assess readiness quickly. It's not about rushing—it's about being efficient with the first few minutes to understand where to invest your time.

### The Script

<speak>
**Consultant:** "Before we dive into specifics, let me ask a few quick questions to make sure I'm showing you things that actually fit. This should just take a couple of minutes."

**Client:** "Sure."
</speak>

**Question 1: Budget**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "What budget range are you working with?"

**Client:** "Around two to three million dirhams."

**Consultant:** "Got it. And would that be cash, or would you be looking at a mortgage?"
</speak>

**Question 2: Timeline**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "What's your timeline looking like? Are you looking to buy soon, or still in the research phase?"

**Client:** "We'd like to buy in the next few months."

**Consultant:** "Okay, so relatively soon. Is there something specific driving that timing?"
</speak>

**Question 3: Need**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "What's the main goal here—is this for living in, rental income, Golden Visa, or something else?"

**Client:** "Mostly investment, but we're interested in the visa too."
</speak>

**Question 4: Authority**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "When it comes to making the decision, is it just yourself, or are there others involved—spouse, business partner, advisor?"

**Client:** "My wife will be involved in the decision."

**Consultant:** "Great. Would it make sense to include her on our next call, or would you prefer to shortlist options first?"
</spend>

**Question 5: Competitive Situation**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "Have you been looking at properties or speaking to other agents, or is this the start of your search?"

**Client:** "We've looked online a bit and spoken to one other agent."

**Consultant:** "Good to know. What was that experience like? Anything that did or didn't work for you?"
</speak>

**Closing the qualifier:**
<speak>
**Consultant:** "Perfect. So you're looking at two to three million for investment with visa benefits, buying in the next few months, you and your wife will decide together, and you've started exploring. Based on that, I have some strong options to show you. Should we set up a time this week to go through them?"
</speak>

## 🎧 Coach Walkthrough

<speak>
**Coach:** Let me show you how to qualify efficiently without feeling like an interrogation. The key is weaving qualification into a natural conversation.

The client—let's call him David—enquired through our website about "investment properties in Dubai." Here's how I open:

**Consultant:** "David, thanks for reaching out. Before we talk about specific properties, I'd like to understand your situation so I can focus on what's actually relevant. Is that okay?"

**David:** "Sure."

**Consultant:** "Great. What drew you to Dubai specifically?"

**David:** "I've heard good things about the returns, and there's no capital gains tax."

**Coach:** I've started with an open question about motivation. Now let me move to budget naturally:

**Consultant:** "Returns and tax efficiency—both good reasons. What budget range are you working with?"

**David:** "Probably around one and a half million."

**Consultant:** "One and a half million dirhams—that gives us solid options. Would that be cash, or would you be financing part of it?"

**David:** "I could do cash for that amount."

**Coach:** Budget qualified. Cash buyer. Now let me check timeline without being blunt about it:

**Consultant:** "Are you actively ready to invest, or still in the research and comparison phase?"

**David:** "Somewhere in between. I'm serious, but I want to understand the market first."

**Coach:** This is a warm lead, not a hot one. He's interested but not urgent. Let me understand the decision dynamic:

**Consultant:** "Makes sense. When it comes to making a decision like this, are you the sole decision-maker, or would others be involved?"

**David:** "It's my decision, but I'd probably get my financial advisor to review the numbers."

**Coach:** Good—he has an advisor who will scrutinize the deal. I need to make sure my recommendations are solid and data-backed. Let me check the competitive landscape:

**Consultant:** "Have you been looking at other markets as well, or is Dubai the focus?"

**David:** "I looked at Portugal briefly—the Golden Visa program. But the property is residential-only now, which doesn't interest me."

**Coach:** Excellent intel. He's compared Dubai to Portugal and chosen Dubai. I can reference this if he hesitates later. Let me close the qualifier:

**Consultant:** "So to summarize: you're looking at around one and a half million for investment, cash purchase, somewhere between research and ready. You'll make the decision but your advisor will review. And you've compared Dubai favorably to Portugal. Did I miss anything?"

**David:** "That's pretty accurate."

**Consultant:** "Perfect. I have a few options that would fit. Let me put together some details—yield calculations, developer info—so there's substance for both you and your advisor to review. Can we schedule a call Friday to walk through them?"

**Coach:** Notice what happened. In about three minutes, I qualified him on all five dimensions. But it felt like a conversation, not an interrogation. I matched his pacing, showed genuine interest, and positioned next steps naturally.

That's the 5-Minute Qualifier done right.

## The Decision Map Framework

For complex purchases, multiple people influence the decision. The Decision Map helps you understand who's involved.

### The Four Roles

**Economic Buyer**
- Has the budget authority
- Signs the check
- Often focused on ROI, value, risk

**User**
- Will actually use/live in the property
- Focused on features, lifestyle fit
- Sometimes different from economic buyer

**Influencer**
- Doesn't decide but shapes the decision
- Could be family, friends, advisors
- Often overlooked but powerful

**Blocker**
- Could veto the deal
- Might not be visible initially
- Often emerges late in the process

### Decision Map Questions

<speak>
**Consultant:** "Who will be involved in making this decision? Walk me through how a decision like this typically gets made in your situation."

**Consultant:** "You mentioned your wife will be involved. What aspects is she most focused on?"

**Consultant:** "Are there any other family members or advisors who might weigh in?"

**Consultant:** "Is there anyone who might have concerns about this purchase that we should address?"
</speak>

### Decision Map Example

**Scenario:** Indian family buying for Golden Visa

| Role | Person | What They Care About |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Economic Buyer | Father (Raj) | ROI, visa qualification, risk |
| User | Adult son (Vikram) | Location, amenities, friends nearby |
| Influencer | Mother (Priya) | Safety, quality, family visits |
| Potential Blocker | Father's business partner | Cash flow impact on business |

**What this tells you:** You need to address Raj's financial concerns, show Vikram properties he'll enjoy, reassure Priya about safety, and provide documentation the business partner can review.

## Handling Common Qualification Challenges

### Challenge 1: They Won't Tell You the Budget

<speak>
**Client:** "I'd rather not say exactly. Just show me what you have."

**Consultant:** "I understand. The reason I ask is that Dubai has everything from AED 500,000 studios to AED 50 million penthouses. To focus your time on relevant options, it helps to know the ballpark. Are we talking one to two million, two to four, or higher?"

**Client:** "Two to three million range."

**Consultant:** "That's helpful. Thank you."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've explained why you're asking and offered ranges instead of asking for an exact number.*

### Challenge 2: "I'm Just Looking"

<speak>
**Client:** "I'm not ready to buy yet. Just looking at what's available."

**Consultant:** "That's fine—many clients start that way. Can I ask what's sparked your interest now? And is there a timeline you're thinking about, even roughly?"

**Client:** "I don't know. Maybe next year sometime."

**Consultant:** "Got it. Would it be helpful if I sent you a few options with information—no pressure—so you can start building a picture of what's available in your budget range?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've respected their timing while gently probing for more, and offered value without pressure.*

### Challenge 3: Decision-Maker Not Available

<speak>
**Client:** "My husband makes these decisions. I'm just doing initial research."

**Consultant:** "That's helpful. What would be most useful for you to bring back to him? And would he be open to joining a call once you've narrowed things down?"

**Client:** "He's pretty busy, but I can share information."

**Consultant:** "Perfect. Let me put together something comprehensive—options, numbers, process overview—so he has everything he needs to evaluate. What questions do you think he'll have?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've respected the dynamic while finding ways to reach the decision-maker indirectly.*

### Challenge 4: Competitive Pressure

<speak>
**Client:** "I'm talking to several agents. What makes you different?"

**Consultant:** "Fair question. Most agents in Dubai focus on closing deals quickly. We focus on understanding what you actually need first. That means we might recommend fewer properties—but they'll be the right ones. What's been your experience with the other agents so far?"

**Client:** "One just sent me fifty listings without asking any questions."

**Consultant:** "That's exactly what we don't do. I'd rather understand your situation and show you five strong options than overwhelm you with everything on the market."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've differentiated on process, not promises, and turned the question back to understand your competition.*

## Practice Checkpoint

Run through the 5-Minute Qualifier with this scenario:

**Setup:** A caller says they're interested in "Dubai investment properties." You know nothing else.

Practice asking qualification questions naturally. Did you cover:
- [ ] Budget range and flexibility?
- [ ] Cash vs. financing?
- [ ] Timeline and what's driving it?
- [ ] Primary goal (yield, growth, visa, lifestyle)?
- [ ] Decision-makers involved?
- [ ] Other agents or markets being considered?

Time yourself. Can you do it in under 5 minutes while keeping it conversational?

---

## Qualification Red Flags and Green Lights

### Red Flags (Low Probability)

- Won't discuss budget even in ranges
- No timeline whatsoever
- Decision-maker is someone they can't get access to
- Already committed to another agent
- Motivation is unclear even after probing
- Only interested in seeing properties, not answering questions

**What to do:** Qualify harder, offer value without investment, or deprioritize.

### Green Lights (High Probability)

- Clear budget with cash available
- Timeline driven by external event (visa expiry, lease end, business need)
- Decision-maker is on the call or easily accessible
- Specific motivation they can articulate
- Already compared options and chose Dubai
- Asking forward-looking questions

**What to do:** Prioritize, move quickly, propose concrete next steps.

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Qualifying too aggressively**
You fire off questions like a checklist. The client feels interrogated. Weave qualification into conversation.

**2. Not qualifying at all**
You skip qualification to "build rapport" and spend an hour with someone who will never buy. Qualify early.

**3. Accepting vague answers**
"Maybe," "someday," and "I'm not sure" aren't answers. Probe for clarity.

**4. Missing the decision-maker**
You qualify the person on the call but miss that their spouse, partner, or advisor has veto power.
