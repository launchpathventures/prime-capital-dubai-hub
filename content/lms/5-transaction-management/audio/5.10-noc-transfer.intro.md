### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

NOC delays have derailed more secondary deals than market fluctuations ever have. Everyone agrees on price, MOU is signed, deposit is paid—then the developer takes three weeks to issue clearance while all parties wait anxiously. If you don't manage this actively, you're gambling with your deal.

Here's what NOC mastery requires.

First, apply immediately after MOU signing—the same day if possible. NOC processing takes seven to twenty-one days minimum. You cannot accelerate this timeline, but you can prevent unnecessary delays by starting early.

Second, outstanding charges block everything. Service charges, maintenance fees, violations—any amount owed stops NOC issuance. Check seller's account status before MOU when possible. Discover surprises before they become crises.

Third, follow up relentlessly. Contact the developer every two to three days. Ask for specific status updates. Escalate through senior contacts if processing stalls. Your clients' transaction timelines depend on your persistence.

Fourth, transfer day requires total preparation. All documents ready, all cheques correct, all parties confirmed. One wrong detail—incorrect payee name, missing mortgage discharge letter, seller's bank representative unavailable—reschedules everything.

The key takeaway: NOC and transfer are where months of work either come together or fall apart. The agent who tracks obsessively, anticipates problems, and prepares thoroughly delivers smooth completions. The one who waits and hopes watches deals unravel.
