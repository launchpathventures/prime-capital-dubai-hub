Welcome to Payment Plan Comparison — a critical skill for off-plan transactions.

Here's what many consultants miss: the same property with different payment plans is effectively a different investment. Payment structure affects cash flow requirements, opportunity cost, risk exposure, and sometimes even total price.

In this module, you'll learn to explain the common structures — sixty-forty, eighty-twenty, forty-sixty, and ten-ninety plans. You'll understand what each structure means in practical terms, not just percentages.

More importantly, you'll learn to help investors choose the right plan for their situation. This isn't about which plan is "better" — it's about which plan matches their cash flow and risk comfort.

You'll also learn to calculate total cost implications. Some plans include price premiums for extended terms. Whether that premium is worth it depends on the investor's cost of capital.

By the end, you'll handle payment plan questions with confidence — explaining mechanics, presenting trade-offs, and guiding decisions without pressure.

Let's see how it's done.
