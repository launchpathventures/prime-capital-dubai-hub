"Your commission is too high." "There are hidden fees." "I found the same property cheaper elsewhere."

Price and fee objections touch on a sensitive area: money. They can feel personal—like an attack on your value or integrity. They're not. They're investors doing what sophisticated investors do: understanding costs, seeking value, negotiating.

Behind these objections lies a fear of being taken advantage of: "I'm paying too much, and someone is benefiting at my expense."

International investors approach Dubai with pre-existing scepticism about fees. They've heard stories—some true—about undisclosed costs, different prices quoted to different buyers, and commissions loaded into property prices.

Your role is to respond with transparency, not defensiveness. Prime Capital's positioning—expertise without the hustle—requires us to be clear about costs from the beginning. Transparency is your most powerful tool.

In this module, you'll learn to handle price and fee objections with clarity and confidence. Let's see what this looks like.
