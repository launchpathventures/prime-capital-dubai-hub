# Create Vision Document

**Role:** You are producing the **Project Vision Document** — the long-lived anchor for the work that follows.

This document clearly articulates **why this project exists, what success looks like, and what matters most**, while making the intended scope of the current phase explicit.

---

## Purpose of the Vision Document

The Vision Document should:
- Align all stakeholders on the project's true intent
- Provide a shared definition of success
- Guide trade-offs and decision-making during delivery
- Prevent feature-led or solution-led drift
- Clarify how a focused POC or MVP fits within a broader ambition

A reader should be able to understand:
> "Why are we doing this, who is it for, what are we trying to prove, and what are we *not* trying to do yet?"

This is not a requirements document.
This is not an implementation plan.
This is a **decision-guiding artefact**.

## Required Structure

### 1. Project Purpose & Context
- What this project is fundamentally about
- The problem or opportunity it exists to address
- The broader context (organisational, cultural, market, or operational)

Focus on *intent*, not solutions.

### 2. North Star & Desired Outcomes
- The core direction this project is aiming toward
- The change this project is intended to create
- What meaningful success looks like if this project goes well

Describe outcomes, not outputs.

### 3. Primary Personas & Core Needs
- Who this project is primarily for
- Key personas or audiences involved
- The core needs, jobs-to-be-done, or tensions for each

Avoid edge cases. Focus on users that matter most for this phase.

### 4. Decision Principles
List principles that should guide decisions when trade-offs arise:
- What should be prioritised over speed, polish, or completeness
- What values, constraints, or risks must be respected
- What matters most when things compete

These principles should be usable during delivery.

### 5. Phase Success Scenarios
Define **1–3 concrete success scenarios** for the current phase (POC or MVP).

For each scenario, include:
- Persona
- Trigger or starting point
- High-level steps
- What success looks like when viewed or demonstrated

These scenarios represent the **minimum convincing proof** that the project is on the right path.

### 6. Vision vs Current Phase Scope
Explicitly separate:
- **The broader vision** (where this could go over time)
- **The scope of the current phase** (what this work is responsible for proving or delivering)

Be clear about:
- What is intentionally included now
- What is intentionally excluded or deferred
- Why that focus is appropriate at this stage

This section is critical for alignment.

### 7. Non-Goals & Boundaries
Clearly state:
- What this project is *not* trying to solve
- What success does *not* require at this stage
- Any known constraints or boundaries that should not be crossed

This protects the vision by limiting dilution.

## Style & Tone

- Clear, grounded, and confident
- Write in **UK English suitable for New Zealand** (unless instructed otherwise)
- Plain English, direct and friendly
- No marketing language or hype
- No technical implementation detail
- Written as a trusted partner aligning a team

---

## Final Check Before Output

Ensure that:
- The vision is clear without prescribing solutions
- The current phase scope is explicitly defined
- A delivery or coding agent could use this to guide decisions
- A stakeholder could read this and understand *why this project matters*

## Your First Response

If context is provided, produce the Vision Document.

If context is missing:
> "I need some context to create the Vision Document. Tell me about:
> - What problem or opportunity this project addresses
> - Who it's for
> - What success would look like
> - Any constraints or principles that matter"
