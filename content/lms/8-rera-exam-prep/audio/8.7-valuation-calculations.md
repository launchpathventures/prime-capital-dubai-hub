### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Calculation questions can make or break your RERA exam score. Unlike knowledge questions where you might make an educated guess, calculations have exact answers. Know the formulas and these become guaranteed marks.

Expect twelve to eighteen questions involving calculations. DLD fees, area conversions, service charges, yield calculations — they all follow specific formulas.

Here are the critical numbers. For area conversion: one square meter equals ten point seven six square feet. Not ten. Not eleven. Ten point seven six. DLD transfer fee is four percent of property value. Mortgage registration is zero point two five percent of the loan amount.

Service charge calculation has a trap: balconies are charged at twenty-five percent of the standard rate, not the full rate.

The three valuation approaches you need to know: Sales Comparison for standard properties in active markets, Income Approach for investment properties focused on rental returns, and Cost Approach for unique or newly constructed properties.

In the walkthrough, we'll work through each calculation type step by step, so you can tackle any number they throw at you with confidence.

### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

**CONTEXT**

On exam day, calculation questions will test whether you can apply formulas correctly under time pressure. The good news is that these follow predictable patterns. Master the formulas and process, and you'll convert these into easy marks.

**THE PROCESS**

Let's work through the main calculation types you'll encounter.

First, area conversions. Square meters to square feet: multiply by ten point seven six. So one hundred square meters becomes one thousand seventy-six square feet. Going the other way, divide by ten point seven six. A fifteen hundred square foot property is about one hundred thirty-nine square meters. Write down ten point seven six on your scratch paper the moment you sit down.

Next, DLD transfer fees. The formula is straightforward: property value times four percent. A two million dirham property means an eighty thousand dirham transfer fee. For mortgage registration, use zero point two five percent of the loan amount, not the property value. A one point six million mortgage means four thousand dirhams in registration fees.

Now service charges. Multiply the internal area by the rate per square foot. But here's the trap: balcony area is charged at twenty-five percent of that rate. So if your internal rate is twenty dirhams per square foot, balconies are charged at five dirhams per square foot. Calculate them separately and add together.

For yield calculations, gross yield is annual rent divided by purchase price, times one hundred. Net yield deducts expenses first: annual rent minus expenses, divided by purchase price, times one hundred. A property costing two million with one hundred forty thousand annual rent and eighteen thousand in expenses has a net yield of six point one percent.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

The first pitfall is mixing up the transfer fee and mortgage registration rates. Four percent is for transfers, zero point two five percent is for mortgages. Second, using the wrong conversion factor — it's ten point seven six, not a rounded number. Third, forgetting the balcony rule and charging full rate on outdoor space. Fourth, confusing gross and net yield by forgetting to deduct expenses.

**PRO TIP**

Before you start the exam, write down the key numbers on your scratch paper: ten point seven six for conversions, four percent for transfers, zero point two five percent for mortgages, twenty-five percent for balcony service charges. Having them visible eliminates the mental overhead when questions appear.
