## Question 1

A client says they have a budget of "around two million dirhams." What's the next essential qualification question?

- [ ] "What areas are you interested in?"
- [ ] "Would that be cash or financing?"
- [ ] "When are you looking to buy?"
- [ ] "Have you looked at properties before?"

**Explanation:** Cash vs. financing fundamentally changes the process and timeline. A cash buyer can move faster; a financed buyer needs mortgage approval, affecting options and timing. This is essential qualifying information that should follow budget discussion immediately.

## Question 2

In the BANT+ framework, what does the "+" represent?

- [ ] Plus other decision-makers
- [ ] The competitive situation
- [ ] Additional budget flexibility
- [ ] Extended timeline considerations

**Explanation:** BANT covers Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. The "+" adds Competitive Situation—understanding what other agents, markets, or options the client is considering. This helps you position effectively and understand the full picture.

## Question 3

A client mentions their wife will be involved in the decision. According to the Decision Map framework, what role does the wife likely play?

- [ ] She's definitely the blocker
- [ ] She could be any of the four roles—economic buyer, user, influencer, or blocker
- [ ] She's automatically the user
- [ ] She's a secondary contact to copy on emails

**Explanation:** Without more information, the wife could play any role. She might be the primary user (if she'll live there), an influencer (sharing opinions), or even the economic buyer (controlling family finances). You need to explore further to understand her specific role in the decision.

## Question 4

A lead says "I'm just looking" when asked about timeline. What's the best response?

- [ ] Deprioritize them as not serious
- [ ] Send them generic market information
- [ ] Probe to understand what sparked their interest and whether there's any timeline context
- [ ] Schedule a follow-up in six months

**Explanation:** "Just looking" can mean genuinely exploratory or hiding hesitation. Probe further: "What sparked your interest now?" and "Is there a timeline you're thinking about, even roughly?" This reveals whether they're truly early-stage or further along than they're admitting.

---

## Question 5

Which combination of BANT+ signals indicates a HOT lead?

- [ ] Clear budget, unclear timeline, single decision-maker, no competition
- [ ] Vague budget, urgent timeline, multiple decision-makers, comparing markets
- [ ] Clear budget, deadline-driven timeline, accessible decision-maker, chose Dubai over alternatives
- [ ] Flexible budget, no timeline, sole decision-maker, first enquiry

**Explanation:** Hot leads have: clear budget (they know what they can spend), deadline-driven timeline (external pressure to act), accessible decision-maker (can reach the person who decides), and have already chosen Dubai over alternatives (past the comparison phase).

## Question 6

During the 5-Minute Qualifier, a client refuses to share their budget. What's the most effective approach?

- [ ] "I can't help you without knowing your budget."
- [ ] "Most clients are looking at one to two million, two to four, or higher. Where do you see yourself?"
- [ ] Skip budget and focus on other qualification areas
- [ ] "Why won't you tell me your budget?"

**Explanation:** Offering ranges is less invasive than asking for specific numbers. It gives the client categories to self-select without feeling exposed. This approach respects their privacy while still getting the information you need to qualify them effectively.

---

## Question 7

A client seems fully qualified—good budget, clear timeline, serious about Dubai—but mentions they're talking to "several other agents." How should this affect your approach?

- [ ] Match whatever the competition offers
- [ ] Differentiate on process and expertise, not promises
- [ ] Offer a lower commission to win the business
- [ ] Assume you've already lost and deprioritize

**Explanation:** Competition means you need to differentiate. The Prime Capital approach is to differentiate on process and expertise—understanding their needs deeply, showing relevant options, being honest about trade-offs—rather than making inflated promises or competing on price.

---

## Question 8

You've completed BANT+ qualification and the client scores low: vague budget, no timeline, decision-maker unavailable, unclear need. What's the appropriate action?

- [ ] Refuse to work with them
- [ ] Invest significant time trying to close them
- [ ] Add them to a nurture sequence and check back periodically
- [ ] Immediately show them properties to generate interest

**Explanation:** Low-qualification leads shouldn't be abandoned, but they shouldn't receive heavy investment. Add them to a nurture sequence—periodic market updates, valuable content—and check back in 3-6 months. Circumstances change; today's browser might become tomorrow's buyer.

---

## Question 9

In the Decision Map, who is the "Blocker"?

- [ ] The person who pays for the property
- [ ] Someone who could veto the deal, often not visible early
- [ ] The real estate attorney
- [ ] The bank providing the mortgage

**Explanation:** A Blocker is someone who could veto the deal—perhaps a skeptical spouse, protective parent, or cautious business partner. They often don't appear until late in the process, which makes early discovery of the full decision-making unit critical.

---

## Question 10

A client says their business partner needs to approve any investment. What does this tell you about Authority in the BANT+ framework?

- [ ] The client has full authority
- [ ] Authority is shared—you need to eventually reach or influence the business partner
- [ ] The business partner is the sole decision-maker
- [ ] This is a red flag and you should deprioritize

**Explanation:** Shared authority means you're not selling to one person. Eventually, the business partner will need to be satisfied—either through the client advocating or through direct engagement. Understanding this helps you prepare materials and strategies that work for both parties.
