# RERA Smart Contracts

## Introduction

The Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) has established standardized contract frameworks to protect all parties in Dubai real estate transactions. Understanding these frameworks—what they contain, what they protect, and what they require—is essential for advising clients professionally.

This module covers the legal structure of RERA-regulated contracts and the protections they provide.

---

## The RERA Contract Framework

### Purpose of Standardization

**Why RERA standardized contracts:**
- **Consumer protection:** Prevent unfair terms that disadvantage buyers
- **Transparency:** Clear understanding of rights and obligations
- **Market integrity:** Professional standards across all transactions
- **Dispute resolution:** Clear basis for resolving conflicts

**Key Principle:**
RERA contracts balance the interests of buyers, sellers, and developers while establishing minimum protections that cannot be waived.

---

## Types of RERA-Regulated Contracts

### 1. Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA)

**Use:** Off-plan property purchases from developers

**Key Characteristics:**
- Governs relationship between buyer and developer
- Includes payment schedule linked to construction
- Specifies completion timeline and handover conditions
- Registered with DLD (Oqood)

### 2. Form F (MOU)

**Use:** Secondary market transactions (resale)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Standard form for buyer-seller agreements
- Includes deposit terms and completion timeline
- Specifies commission obligations
- Filed with DLD for transfer

### 3. Form A (Agency Agreement)

**Use:** Formal engagement of real estate agent

**Key Characteristics:**
- Establishes agent-client relationship
- Defines scope of services
- Specifies commission terms
- Can be exclusive or non-exclusive

### 4. Tenancy Contract (Ejari)

**Use:** Rental agreements

**Key Characteristics:**
- Registered with Ejari system
- Standard terms for residential/commercial
- Specifies rent, payment terms, duration
- Required for visa and utility purposes

---

## SPA: Critical Clauses

### Completion and Handover

**Standard Provisions:**

**Completion Date:**
- Estimated completion date must be stated
- Developer allowed grace period (typically 12 months)
- Buyer rights if grace period exceeded

**Handover Definition:**
- What constitutes "completion ready"
- Snagging process and defects period
- Conditions for refusing handover

**Important for Clients:**
> "The SPA states completion is expected by [date] with a 12-month grace period. This means the developer must deliver by [grace period date], or you have the right to cancel and receive a full refund. In practice, most projects deliver within the grace period, but this clause protects you if there are significant delays."

### Payment Terms

**Standard Provisions:**

**Payment Schedule:**
- Linked to construction milestones, OR
- Fixed dates regardless of construction progress

**Late Payment:**
- Developer's right to charge interest/penalties
- Developer's right to cancel for persistent non-payment
- Notice period required before cancellation

**Escrow Protection:**
- All payments to registered escrow account
- Funds released to developer per construction progress

**Important for Clients:**
> "Your payments are protected in an escrow account—the developer can only access funds as construction milestones are completed. This means your money isn't used for other projects, and if the developer fails, there's a mechanism for recovery."

### Cancellation Rights

**Buyer Cancellation:**
- 14-day cooling-off period (off-plan only)
- Cancellation if developer exceeds grace period
- Refund amounts and timelines

**Developer Cancellation:**
- Right to cancel for buyer payment default
- Notice requirements
- Refund obligations (typically refund minus penalties)

**Important for Clients:**
> "You have 14 days after signing to cancel for any reason—this is your cooling-off period. After that, cancellation becomes more complex. If the developer significantly delays beyond the grace period, you can request a full refund. If you need to cancel for personal reasons, there will be penalties per the contract terms."

### Specifications and Quality

**Standard Provisions:**

**Specifications Sheet:**
- Detailed list of finishes, fixtures, materials
- Brand standards or equivalents
- Unit size and layout confirmation

**Variations:**
- Developer's right to make minor changes
- Buyer's rights if significant changes
- Approval process for buyer-requested changes

**Defects Liability:**
- Period for developer to fix defects (typically 1 year)
- Process for reporting and remediation
- Structural warranty requirements

---

## Form F: Key Components

### The Standard Form

Form F is the RERA-mandated Memorandum of Understanding for secondary market transactions.

**Mandatory Elements:**

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Parties | Full details of buyer, seller, and agents |
| Property | Title deed details, unit description, parking |
| Price | Purchase price, payment breakdown |
| Deposit | Amount, holder, forfeiture conditions |
| Completion | Target date, extension conditions |
| Conditions | Subject to NOC, mortgage, etc. |
| Commission | Amount, who pays, when payable |
| Signatures | All parties and witnesses |

### Deposit Terms

**Standard Practice:**
- 10% of purchase price
- Held by conveyancing office (not agents)
- Forfeited to seller if buyer defaults
- Returned to buyer if seller defaults
- Released to seller upon transfer completion

**Important for Clients:**
> "The 10% deposit secures the property and demonstrates your commitment. If you don't complete—unless the seller is at fault—you lose this deposit. If the seller doesn't complete, they must return your deposit plus compensation."

### Completion Timeline

**Standard Terms:**
- Target completion date stated
- Typically 30-60 days from signing
- Subject to NOC and financing conditions
- Consequences of delay by either party

**Extension Provisions:**
- Mutual agreement required
- Additional costs if applicable
- Termination rights if extended too long

---

## Form A: Agency Agreement

### Purpose

Form A establishes the formal relationship between agent and client, clarifying:
- Scope of services
- Exclusivity (if any)
- Commission terms
- Duration of agreement

### Types of Agency

**Exclusive Agency:**
- Client works only with this agent
- Agent entitled to commission regardless of who finds buyer/seller
- Higher commitment from agent expected

**Non-Exclusive Agency:**
- Client may work with multiple agents
- Commission paid only to agent who completes transaction
- More common in Dubai market

### Commission Terms

**Buyer's Agent:**
- Typically 2% of purchase price + VAT
- Payable upon completion of transaction
- Shared if co-broke (multiple agents involved)

**Seller's Agent:**
- Typically 2% of sale price + VAT
- Payable upon completion of transaction
- May be paid from proceeds at transfer
