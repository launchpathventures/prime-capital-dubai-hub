## Question 1

What is the "next step close" approach?

- [ ] Asking directly if the client is ready to buy
- [ ] Presenting a deadline by which they need to decide
- [x] Summarizing their reasons for buying, then presenting the next action as a logical progression
- [ ] Offering a discount if they commit immediately

**Explanation:** The "next step close" avoids putting clients on the spot with a direct buy/don't buy question. Instead, you reflect back their own reasons for the purchase fitting their needs, then present the next step (like the EOI) as the natural progression—focusing on process ("Would you like me to walk you through how that works?") rather than commitment.

## Question 2

A client shows these behaviors: asking about specific floor preferences, discussing timing with their spouse present, and asking how payment plans work. What do these signals suggest?

- [ ] They're still in early research mode
- [x] They're showing strong buying signals and may be ready to discuss the EOI
- [ ] They're trying to negotiate a better price
- [ ] They need more property options to compare

**Explanation:** These are classic buying signals: specific questions about units (not general), involving decision-makers (spouse present), and forward-looking questions about process (payment plans). This client has moved past "should I buy in Dubai?" to "how do I buy this property?" They may be ready to advance to the EOI discussion.

## Question 3

A client has been engaged and positive throughout your conversations, but when you mention the EOI, they suddenly seem uncomfortable. What should you do?

- [ ] Push through the discomfort—they'll feel better once they commit
- [ ] Back off completely and let them reach out when they're ready
- [x] Step back and ask what would help them feel confident about moving forward
- [ ] Offer to reduce the EOI amount to make it feel like a smaller commitment

**Explanation:** Visible discomfort at the closing step signals an unresolved concern—pushing through creates resistance and often kills deals. The best approach is to step back, acknowledge what you're observing, and explore what's driving the hesitation. Often there's a specific concern that can be addressed once surfaced. You can't reduce an EOI amount—that's set by the developer.

## Question 4

When is it appropriate to step back rather than advance toward closing?

- [ ] When the client asks about price comparisons with other properties
- [ ] When the deal value is lower than your target
- [x] When key decision-makers haven't been involved in the conversation
- [ ] When the client has only seen one property option

**Explanation:** Advancing toward close when important decision-makers haven't been engaged almost always backfires—the absent party doesn't have the relationship or understanding, and often vetoes. Step back, bring them into the conversation, and then advance together. Price comparisons and seeing only one option aren't necessarily reasons to slow down if the client is otherwise ready.

## Question 5

A client says "I want to proceed, but what if something better comes along after I commit?" Which response best addresses this concern?

- [ ] "That's unlikely—this is one of the best projects available"
- [ ] "You can always sell the unit if you find something better"
- [x] "There will always be new launches. The question is: does this property meet your needs at today's price? And remember, the EOI is refundable until you sign the SPA"
- [ ] "Let's look at a few more options so you can be certain this is the best one"

**Explanation:** This concern is about fear of missing out on a better option—it's normal buyer psychology. The best response acknowledges that new options will always exist (honesty), reframes the decision around whether this property meets their criteria (not whether it's the "best" in abstract), and reminds them of the refundability safety net. Suggesting more options delays decision without resolving the underlying concern.
