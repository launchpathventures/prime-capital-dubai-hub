Let me walk you through building a follow-up system that actually works.

Start with the post-transaction sequence. On day one after completion, send a personal congratulations message. This can be an email or, even better, a handwritten note. Acknowledge their achievement and let them know you will be in touch to ensure everything settles smoothly.

One week later, send an administrative follow-up. Check that they have received all their documentation — title deed copy, payment confirmation, developer contacts. This shows you are still engaged after the deal closes and catches any missing items early.

At the four-week mark, do a satisfaction check. Ask how they are feeling about the acquisition and whether any questions have come up. This surfaces issues while they are still addressable and demonstrates ongoing attention. It also opens the door for referral conversations if they express high satisfaction.

At month three, provide a value-add touch. Share a market update relevant to their property, rental yield data if they are leasing, or news about their developer or neighbourhood. This keeps you present with substance, not sales. The key is relevance — do not send generic updates.

Month six is your relationship continuation point. Schedule a check-in call or meeting to maintain the relationship beyond the transaction. Position this as an opportunity to catch up and share market developments. Ask about their experience and whether they are considering expanding their portfolio.

Finally, at the one-year mark, offer an annual portfolio review. This positions you as an ongoing advisor, not a one-time salesperson. Prepare an analysis comparing their purchase price to current valuations and rental yields. This meeting often sparks conversations about additional acquisitions.

For your CRM setup, configure automatic tasks triggered by completion dates. Completion date creates day one congratulations. Completion plus seven days creates the week one follow-up. Completion plus thirty days triggers the satisfaction check. And so on through the sequence. This automation ensures nothing falls through the cracks. Also set up recurring quarterly check-ins for clients in your nurture segment.

Beyond the sequence, maintain presence through the year with meaningful touchpoints. Acknowledge transaction anniversaries, share relevant market news when it affects their property, and send thoughtful seasonal contacts two or three times per year.

Common pitfalls to avoid. First, thinking you will remember to follow up without setting a CRM task. You will not. Second, sending generic "checking in" messages with no specific value. Third, using the same follow-up cadence for all clients regardless of their engagement level. Fourth, only reaching out when you want something from them.

Here is your pro tip. After every client interaction, immediately log it and set the next follow-up before you move on. Never close a contact record without a next step scheduled. This single discipline will transform your client retention.

Your follow-up system is what separates consultants who build careers from those who just close deals.
