# EOI & Booking Conversion

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **guide interested clients through the Expression of Interest (EOI) and booking process** smoothly—building excitement, handling hesitation, and securing commitment while maintaining the advisory positioning that defines Prime Capital.

---

## Understanding the EOI Process

Before mastering the conversion conversation, you need to understand what you're asking clients to do and why.

### What is an EOI?

An Expression of Interest (EOI) is a preliminary commitment—typically AED 20,000-100,000 depending on the developer and project—that secures a client's position for unit selection.

**Key points to communicate:**
- The EOI is typically refundable if the client decides not to proceed to booking
- It demonstrates serious intent and secures priority in unit allocation
- It's converted to the deposit when the booking is confirmed
- The amount varies by developer (Emaar typically higher than others)

### The EOI-to-Booking Timeline

| Stage | What Happens | Timeframe |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| EOI Submission | Client pays EOI, completes basic form | Day 1 |
| Unit Selection | Client chooses specific unit from available inventory | Day 1-3 |
| Sales Admin | Developer admin processes the booking | Day 3-5 |
| SPA Generation | Sales & Purchase Agreement prepared | Day 5-10 |
| Booking Confirmation | Client signs SPA, EOI converts to deposit | Day 10-14 |

## The Conversion Conversation

### Recognizing Genuine Buying Signals

Not every interested client is ready to book. Learn to recognize signals that indicate genuine readiness:

**Strong buying signals:**
- Asking specific questions about payment process and timing
- Discussing the property with family/partners in positive terms
- Asking about unit availability and floor preferences
- Inquiring about next steps unprompted
- Comparing specific units rather than properties

**Weaker signals (need more work):**
- "This is interesting" without specifics
- Questions focused only on negatives or risks
- No mention of timeline or decision process
- Comparing this property to very different alternatives

### The "Next Step Close"

Prime Capital consultants don't ask for the sale directly. We guide clients to the logical next step.

<speak>
**You:** "Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like this property aligns well with what you're looking for—the yield numbers work, the location makes sense for your goals, and the payment plan fits your preferences.

The natural next step would be to secure your position with an Expression of Interest. This is AED 50,000 that reserves your spot for unit selection and is refundable if you decide not to proceed. Would you like me to walk you through how that works?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've summarized their own reasons for buying, then presented the EOI as a logical progression rather than a pressure decision. You've offered to explain rather than just asking for money.*

### Handling "I Need to Think About It"

This is the most common response. How you handle it determines whether you lose momentum or maintain it.

**Don't do this:**

<speak>
**You (wrong):** "Of course, take all the time you need. Just let me know when you're ready."
</speak>

*This loses all momentum. They'll think about it, get distracted, and forget.*

**Do this:**

<speak>
**You:** "Absolutely, it's an important decision. Can I ask—what specifically would you want to think through? Is it the property itself, the timing, or something else? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've respected their need to think while uncovering what's actually holding them back. Often "I need to think about it" is a polite way of expressing a specific concern you can address.*

**Follow-up based on their response:**

If it's about the property:
<speak>
**You:** "That makes sense. Would it help to compare this against another option I mentioned? Sometimes seeing the contrast clarifies the decision."
</speak>

If it's about timing:
<speak>
**You:** "I understand. Can I share what happens if you wait? The specific unit we discussed may not be available next week, though other units will be. Is availability something that matters to you, or are you flexible on the specific unit?"
</speak>

If they need to consult someone:
<speak>
**You:** "Of course—who else is involved in the decision? Would it be helpful to schedule a call where I can walk through the investment case with both of you? That often makes the discussion easier."
</speak>

## 🎧 Coach Walkthrough: Handling EOI Hesitation

<speak>
**Coach:** Let's walk through a realistic EOI conversation where the client is interested but hesitating. This is where deals are won or lost.

The client is Fatima, a UAE national who's been looking at off-plan apartments for her daughter. You've presented a 1-bedroom in a new Emaar project. She likes it, but she's not quite ready to commit.

**Consultant:** "Based on our conversation, it sounds like this unit checks the boxes—good location for your daughter's work, reputable developer, and the price point is comfortable. The Expression of Interest is AED 75,000 and secures your unit selection priority. Would you like me to walk you through the process?"

**Fatima:** "I'm interested, but I'd like to think about it first."

**Coach:** Notice—she didn't say no. She said she wants to think. This is a buying signal wrapped in hesitation. Don't retreat. Explore.

**Consultant:** "Of course. Can I ask what specifically you'd want to think through? Is it the property, the timing, or something else? I want to make sure you have everything you need to feel confident."

**Fatima:** "I'm just wondering if this is the best option. There are so many projects launching."

**Coach:** This is useful. She's not objecting to THIS property—she's worried about missing something better. This is addressable.

**Consultant:** "That's a fair concern. There are always new launches. Here's how I think about it: this project has early-access pricing because it just launched. In three months, the same unit will likely be 5-10% higher if the sales trajectory continues. The question isn't 'is there something better'—there's always something new—it's 'does this property meet your daughter's needs at a price that works?'"

**Fatima:** "When you put it that way... I suppose she did like this one."

**Consultant:** "And importantly, the EOI is refundable. You're not committing AED 75,000 permanently—you're reserving the option to proceed. If something dramatically better comes along in the next two weeks, you can change your mind. But you can't reverse-engineer the choice if this unit sells."

**Coach:** I've reframed the decision. It's not "commit forever" versus "keep looking." It's "secure the option" versus "risk losing it." That's a much easier yes.

**Fatima:** "Okay, let's do it. What do I need to do?"

**Consultant:** "Great choice. I'll send you the EOI form—it's straightforward. You'll need a copy of your Emirates ID and the AED 75,000 transfer to the developer's escrow account. Once that's done, we'll schedule the unit selection. Sound good?"

**Coach:** Notice the ending. I confirmed her decision, made the next steps clear, and closed with a question that's easy to say yes to. Momentum maintained.
</speak>

## Creating Urgency Without Pressure

There's a difference between manufactured pressure ("You have to decide TODAY!") and legitimate urgency.

### Legitimate Urgency Sources

**Unit availability:** "This floor only has three units left. If the specific view matters to you, we should move soon."

**Pricing phases:** "This is launch pricing. Phase 2 typically increases 8-12%."

**Payment plan windows:** "The extended payment plan is only available for the next two weeks."

**Your client's timeline:** "You mentioned wanting this settled before Ramadan. To hit that timeline, we'd need to start the booking process this week."

### How to Present Urgency Appropriately

<speak>
**You:** "I want to be transparent about timing. I'm not trying to pressure you—take the time you need. But I also don't want you to assume this unit will wait. At the current sales pace, the 12th floor units will likely be gone by end of week. If the floor matters to you, that's relevant context."
</speak>

*Why this works: You've acknowledged you're not pressuring, provided factual information, and let them decide. This is advisory, not pushy.*

---

## The EOI Process Walkthrough

When a client agrees to proceed, walk them through clearly:

<speak>
**You:** "Here's what happens next.

First, I'll send you the EOI form—it's a simple one-page document with your details and the property you're reserving.

Second, you'll transfer the EOI amount—AED 75,000—to the developer's escrow account. I'll send you the exact bank details. It's important this goes to the official escrow, not to Prime Capital or any individual.

Third, once the EOI is received, you'll get priority for unit selection. I'll coordinate with the developer and we'll schedule a time—usually within 48 hours—to review available inventory and lock in your specific unit.

Fourth, after unit selection, the developer generates the Sales & Purchase Agreement. You'll have 14 days to review and sign, and your EOI converts to the first payment.

Any questions about the process?"
</speak>

*Why this works: You've demystified the process. No surprises. The client knows exactly what to expect.*

## Practice Checkpoint

You've just finished presenting a property. The client says "This looks really good. Let me discuss with my wife and get back to you."

Write out your response. Then check:

- Did you acknowledge their need to discuss?
- Did you ask what specifically they'll discuss?
- Did you offer to help (joint call, additional information)?
- Did you establish a specific next step with a timeline?

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Asking "Would you like to proceed?" without context**

❌ "So, would you like to book this?"

✅ Summarize their reasons, present the next step logically, offer to explain the process.

**2. Accepting vague follow-up**

❌ "Let me know when you're ready" → They never call back

✅ "When would be good for us to reconnect? I'd suggest Wednesday—that gives you time to think but keeps momentum."

**3. Creating false urgency**

❌ "This is going to sell today, you have to decide now"

✅ Share legitimate information about availability or pricing without manufacturing panic.

---

## Quick Reference Card

**EOI Conversation Flow:**
1. Recognize buying signals
2. Summarize their reasons (not yours)
3. Present EOI as logical next step
4. Explain the process clearly
5. Handle hesitation by exploring the concern
6. Create appropriate urgency with facts
7. Confirm and clarify next steps

**Key Phrases:**
- "The natural next step would be..."
- "What specifically would you want to think through?"
- "The EOI is refundable if you decide not to proceed"
- "I'm not trying to pressure you—but I want you to have accurate information about timing"

**When They Need to Think:**
- Ask what specifically they're considering
- Offer to address concerns or provide more information
- Suggest involving other decision-makers
- Establish a specific follow-up timeline

---

## Key Takeaways

- Recognize genuine buying signals versus polite interest—tailor your approach accordingly
- Use the "next step close"—guide clients to the logical progression rather than asking directly for money
- When they "need to think," explore what specifically—often there's an addressable concern underneath
- Create urgency with legitimate facts about availability and pricing, never manufactured pressure
- Walk through the EOI process clearly so clients know exactly what to expect—no surprises builds trust
- Always establish a specific next step with timeline—vague follow-up loses deals
