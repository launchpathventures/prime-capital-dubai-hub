### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

Let me walk you through completing a Form F MOU correctly—the document that makes secondary transactions legally binding and protects all parties when done right.

CONTEXT: When you'll use this and why it matters.

Form F is signed when buyer and seller agree on terms for a resale property. Unlike off-plan SPAs drafted by developers, you're responsible for ensuring this document is accurate and complete. Mistakes here create disputes at transfer, lost deposits, and damaged relationships. Getting it right the first time prevents problems that take weeks to resolve.

THE PROCESS: Step-by-step walkthrough with practical tips.

Step one—gather source documents before drafting. You need the seller's original title deed for property details and their exact name. You need the buyer's passport for their exact name and identification. Request these documents in advance and have them in front of you while completing the form.

Step two—complete the parties section with precision. Enter the seller's name exactly as it appears on the title deed—not as they sign emails, not as their business card reads. Enter the buyer's name exactly as it appears on their passport. Add passport numbers, Emirates ID numbers, and contact details for both parties. Include all agent details with RERA broker numbers.

Step three—enter property details from the title deed. Building name, unit number, plot number, community, size in square feet. List parking spaces if included—note their deed numbers if separate. Specify any other inclusions—furniture, fixtures, storage units. If you're including furniture, attach a detailed inventory list.

Step four—document price and payment structure clearly. Enter the total purchase price in numbers and words—these must match. Specify the deposit amount, typically ten percent, and note it's payable to the conveyancing office, not to agents or individuals. Show the balance calculation and when it's due.

Step five—draft conditions precedent with specificity. If the buyer needs mortgage approval, write: "Subject to buyer obtaining mortgage pre-approval of minimum AED one point five million within fourteen days of this agreement." Not just "subject to financing." If there are other conditions—inspection, NOC timing, specific inclusions—document each with clear criteria and deadlines.

Step six—set a realistic completion timeline. Standard is thirty to sixty days from signing. Factor in NOC processing time, mortgage approval if applicable, and all parties' availability. Include extension provisions: "Either party may request extension of up to fourteen days with written consent of the other party."

Step seven—specify commission terms in writing. Who pays whom, what percentage, when payable. Typically: "Buyer shall pay commission of two percent plus VAT to Agent A upon completion. Seller shall pay commission of two percent plus VAT to Agent B upon completion."

Step eight—obtain signatures and collect deposit. Review the completed form with all parties before signing. Ensure everyone signs in all required places. Collect the deposit cheque made payable to the conveyancing office. Issue a receipt.

COMMON PITFALLS: Mistakes to avoid.

First, name mismatches. The most common error—and the most problematic at transfer.

Second, vague conditions. "Subject to financing" without specifics creates arguments about whether the condition was satisfied.

Third, deposit to wrong party. Deposits must go to a licensed trustee or conveyancing office—never to agents personally.

PRO TIP: One insider technique.

Create a Form F checklist you use for every transaction. Check each field against source documents. Before anyone signs, read the critical fields aloud: "Confirming seller name is... buyer name is... unit number is... price is... deposit to..." This thirty-second verification catches errors that would otherwise take weeks to correct.
