## Question 1

A property costs AED 1,500,000 and generates AED 90,000 in annual rent. What is the gross yield?

- A) 5.0%
- B) 6.0%
- C) 6.5%
- D) 7.0%

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Gross yield = (Annual rent / Purchase price) × 100 = (90,000 / 1,500,000) × 100 = 6.0%

## Question 2

Which of the following costs should be subtracted from gross rental income when calculating net yield?

- A) Service charges only
- B) Service charges and vacancy allowance only
- C) Service charges, property management, vacancy allowance, and maintenance reserve
- D) Purchase costs including DLD fees

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Net yield accounts for recurring operating costs: service charges, property management fees (if applicable), vacancy allowance, and maintenance reserves. Purchase costs like DLD fees are capital costs, not operating costs.

## Question 3

A 1,200 sqft apartment has service charges of AED 20 per square foot annually. What is the total annual service charge?

- A) AED 20,000
- B) AED 24,000
- C) AED 12,000
- D) AED 2,400

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Total service charge = Size × Rate = 1,200 × AED 20 = AED 24,000

---

## Question 4

Property A has a gross yield of 7.0%. Property B has a gross yield of 5.5%. Without additional information, which statement is most accurate?

- A) Property A is the better investment
- B) Property B is the better investment
- C) Gross yield alone cannot determine which is the better investment
- D) Property A has lower operating costs

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Gross yield is useful for quick comparisons but doesn't account for operating costs, capital appreciation potential, location quality, or other factors that affect total return. A property with lower gross yield may have lower costs, better appreciation, or stronger resale liquidity.

## Question 5

An investor purchases a property for AED 2,000,000. Annual rent is AED 140,000 and annual operating costs total AED 45,000. What is the net yield?

- A) 7.0%
- B) 4.75%
- C) 2.25%
- D) 5.5%

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Net operating income = 140,000 - 45,000 = AED 95,000. Net yield = (95,000 / 2,000,000) × 100 = 4.75%

---

## Question 6

A property purchased 3 years ago for AED 1,800,000 is now worth AED 2,200,000. Annual net rental income is AED 75,000. What is the approximate annual total return?

- A) 4.2%
- B) 7.4%
- C) 11.5%
- D) 22.2%

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Annual capital gain = (2,200,000 - 1,800,000) / 3 = AED 133,333. Annual total return = (75,000 + 133,333) / 1,800,000 × 100 = 11.6% (approximately 11.5%)

---

## Question 7

When presenting yield figures to a sophisticated investor, which approach is most appropriate?

- A) Quote gross yield as it's higher and more impressive
- B) Quote net yield without showing the calculation
- C) Quote both gross and net yield, showing how you arrived at each figure
- D) Quote whichever yield makes the property look best

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Transparency builds trust. Show both gross and net yield with your calculations. Sophisticated investors want to see the working and will lose confidence if they later discover the figures were misleading.

## Question 8

Two apartments have the same purchase price and gross yield, but Property A is in a branded residence with service charges of AED 28/sqft, while Property B is in a standard building with service charges of AED 14/sqft. Both properties are 1,000 sqft. How much more do Property A's service charges cost annually?

- A) AED 7,000
- B) AED 14,000
- C) AED 28,000
- D) AED 42,000

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Property A service charges = 1,000 × 28 = AED 28,000. Property B service charges = 1,000 × 14 = AED 14,000. Difference = AED 14,000.

## Question 9

An investor says: "I need at least 5% net yield." You've found a property priced at AED 1,200,000 with annual rent of AED 78,000 and estimated annual operating costs of AED 15,000. Does this property meet their requirement?

- A) Yes, the net yield is 5.25%
- B) No, the net yield is 4.8%
- C) Yes, the gross yield is 6.5%
- D) Cannot be determined from this information

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation:** Net operating income = 78,000 - 15,000 = AED 63,000. Net yield = (63,000 / 1,200,000) × 100 = 5.25%. This exceeds the 5% requirement.

---

## Question 10

Which of the following is NOT typically included when calculating net yield?

- A) Annual service charges
- B) Property management fees
- C) DLD transfer fees (4%)
- D) Vacancy allowance

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** DLD transfer fees are a one-time purchase cost, not a recurring operating expense. Net yield calculations include recurring costs: service charges, property management, vacancy allowance, and maintenance. Purchase costs affect total investment amount but not ongoing yield.
