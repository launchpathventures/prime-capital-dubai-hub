# Discovery: Visa-Seekers

For visa-seekers, the property is a means to an end—UAE residency. Your discovery must understand their residency goals while ensuring they don't overlook property fundamentals. A bad property that qualifies for Golden Visa is still a bad property.

## The Visa-Seeker Discovery Framework

### Opening the Conversation

Visa-seekers are often direct about their goal. Acknowledge it while signaling that you'll help them make a sound decision, not just meet minimum requirements.

**Opening Script**:
> "Thank you for reaching out. You mentioned the Golden Visa—that's a great program. Before we look at qualifying properties, I'd like to understand your broader situation so we can find something that works for residency and as an investment. Does that approach work for you?"

This opening establishes:
- You understand their primary goal
- You're thinking beyond minimum compliance
- You'll protect their interests

---

## Discovery Question Sequence

### Section 1: Residency Objectives

Understand why they need UAE residency.

**Key Questions**:

> "What's driving your interest in UAE residency? Is it for personal residence, business, or as a travel document benefit?"

> "Will you be relocating to the UAE, or is this primarily for access and flexibility?"

> "Are there family members you'd want to include on the visa—spouse, children, parents?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Actual use case (living vs. access)
- Family structure and eligibility scope
- Underlying motivation (stability, business, travel)

---

### Section 2: Timeline & Urgency

Visa-seekers often have external deadlines.

**Key Questions**:

> "What's your timeline for obtaining the visa? Is there any urgency?"

> "Are there specific dates driving this—visa renewals elsewhere, business requirements, travel plans?"

> "If timeline is critical, would you prioritize speed of completion over finding the optimal property?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Hard deadlines vs. flexible timeline
- Willingness to compromise on property for speed
- External pressures (current visa status, business needs)

---

### Section 3: Golden Visa Knowledge

Assess their understanding and fill gaps.

**Key Questions**:

> "How familiar are you with the Golden Visa requirements? Would a quick overview be helpful?"

> "Are you aware that the AED 2M minimum must be in a completed property, or held in escrow for off-plan purchases that meet certain criteria?"

> "Do you know the visa duration and renewal requirements?"

**Educational Points to Cover**:

- **Minimum Investment**: AED 2 million in property
- **Property Requirement**: Can be single or multiple properties totaling AED 2M
- **Off-Plan Rules**: Off-plan qualifies if purchased from approved developers with specific escrow arrangements
- **Visa Duration**: 10 years, renewable
- **Family Inclusion**: Spouse and children included; parents may require separate application
- **Business Flexibility**: Visa holders can establish companies, open bank accounts
- **Exit Requirements**: No minimum stay requirement

---

### Section 4: Secondary Objectives

Most visa-seekers have secondary goals beyond just the visa.

**Key Questions**:

> "Once the visa requirement is met, what else matters to you about the property?"

> "Would you ever live in this property, use it as a holiday home, or is it purely an investment?"

> "How important is rental yield while you hold the property?"

> "Do you have views on location, property type, or developer preference?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Pure visa vs. hybrid objectives
- Personal use potential
- Yield expectations
- Any property preferences beyond threshold

---

### Section 5: Budget & Structure

Understand their financial approach to meeting the threshold.

**Key Questions**:

> "Are you looking to invest exactly AED 2M to meet the threshold, or is your budget higher?"

> "Would you consider a single property at AED 2M+, or multiple smaller properties totaling AED 2M?"

> "Will you be paying cash, or would you consider financing? Note: For Golden Visa, the property value counts regardless of financing."

> "Is the AED 2M coming from liquid funds, or does it depend on other transactions?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Budget flexibility above minimum
- Single vs. multiple property preference
- Financing interest
- Liquidity and timing

---

### Section 6: Concerns & Questions

Address common visa-seeker concerns.

**Key Questions**:

> "What questions or concerns do you have about the Golden Visa process?"

> "Are you working with an immigration advisor, or would you like recommendations?"

> "Is there anything about Dubai property ownership that concerns you?"

**Common Concerns to Address**:

- **Processing Time**: Typically 2-4 weeks after property registration
- **Document Requirements**: Passport, property title deed, Emirates ID application
- **Banking**: Can open UAE bank accounts once visa is processed
- **Business Setup**: Visa enables company formation
- **Tax Implications**: UAE has no income tax, but check home country implications

---

### Section 7: Decision Process

Understand how they'll make the decision.

**Key Questions**:

> "Are you the sole decision-maker, or will others be involved?"

> "What would you need to see or know to move forward with a purchase?"

> "Are you comparing Dubai to other residency programs?"

**What You're Listening For**:
- Decision authority
- Information needs
- Competitive alternatives (Portugal, Caribbean programs)

## Coach Walkthrough: Visa-Seeker Discovery Practice

*This section demonstrates visa-seeker discovery technique through a realistic dialogue. The `<speak>` tags indicate content optimized for text-to-speech practice.*

<speak>

### Scenario

**Client Background**: Raj, an Indian tech entrepreneur with global operations. Wants UAE residency for business convenience and tax efficiency. Family includes wife and two adult children.

**Your Task**: Conduct discovery balancing visa objectives with sound property selection.

### Sample Discovery Dialogue

**You**: "Raj, thank you for reaching out. You mentioned the Golden Visa is a priority—that's a great program for entrepreneurs. Before we look at qualifying properties, I'd like to understand your broader situation. Does that work for you?"

**Raj**: "Yes, please. I need the visa mainly for business reasons. I'm in and out of the UAE frequently and tired of tourist visas."

**You**: "That makes complete sense. Will you be relocating here, or is this primarily for access and flexibility?"

**Raj**: "Flexibility mainly. My business is global—I'm in Singapore, London, Dubai regularly. I want a base here but won't be resident full-time."

**You**: "Understood. You mentioned family—would you want to include them on the visa? Spouse, children?"

**Raj**: "My wife definitely. The children are adults now with their own arrangements, but good to know it's an option."

**You**: "Perfect. What's your timeline for obtaining the visa? Any urgency?"

**Raj**: "I'd like to have this sorted within 3-4 months if possible. My current business visa situation is complicated."

**You**: "We can work with that timeline. Ready properties would complete faster than off-plan. Let me ask—beyond meeting the AED 2M threshold, what else matters to you about the property?"

**Raj**: "I want it to make sense as an investment. If I'm putting AED 2M somewhere, it should generate decent returns, not just sit there."
