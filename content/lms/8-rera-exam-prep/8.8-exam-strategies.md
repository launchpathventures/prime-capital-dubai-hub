# Exam Strategies & Time Management

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **apply strategic exam-taking techniques** to manage your time effectively, recognize question patterns, and maximize your RERA exam score.

---

## Why This Matters

Knowing the content is only half the battle. Many candidates who know the material well still struggle because they:

- Run out of time
- Misread questions
- Fall for common traps
- Panic on difficult questions

This module gives you the tactical skills to perform at your best on exam day.

## Time Management Fundamentals

### The 90-Second Rule

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** You have approximately **90 seconds per question**.

**Exam Structure:**
- Total questions: ~50-60 questions
- Total time: 75-90 minutes
- Time per question: **~90 seconds**

### Time Allocation Strategy

| Phase | Time | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| First pass | 60 minutes | Answer all questions you know |
| Review flagged | 15 minutes | Return to difficult questions |
| Final check | 10 minutes | Review answers, verify calculations |

### The 90-Second Breakdown

For each question:
- **Read question:** 15 seconds
- **Consider options:** 30 seconds
- **Select answer:** 15 seconds
- **Review:** 30 seconds
- **Move on or flag:** Immediate decision

### When to Skip and Flag

**Skip immediately if:**
- You don't recognize the topic at all
- The question requires complex calculation you can't start
- You've spent 2 minutes and are not close to an answer

**Flag and return if:**
- You're between two options
- You need more time to calculate
- The question seems tricky

---

## Question Pattern Recognition

### Pattern 1: True/False Statements

**Format:** "Which statement is TRUE?" or "Which statement is FALSE?"

**Strategy:**
1. Read ALL options before deciding
2. Look for absolute words ("always," "never," "all," "none")
3. Absolute statements are usually FALSE
4. Specific, qualified statements are usually TRUE

**Example:**

"Which statement about DLD fees is TRUE?"
- A) Transfer fees are always paid by the buyer ❌ (absolute—varies by negotiation)
- B) The transfer fee is 4% of the property value ✅ (specific, factual)
- C) Mortgage registration is never required ❌ (absolute)
- D) Trustee fees are always AED 5,000 ❌ (absolute—can be AED 4,000)

### Pattern 2: "All of the Above"

**Format:** Options A, B, C + "D) All of the above"

**Strategy:**
1. If you're certain TWO options are correct, "All of the above" is likely correct
2. If you're certain ONE option is wrong, eliminate "All of the above"
3. Don't assume "All of the above" is always the answer—verify each option

**Example:**

"Which can act as a property trustee in Dubai?"
- A) DLD Service Centers ✅
- B) Developer Trustees ✅
- C) Bank Trustees ✅
- D) All of the above ✅ (Correct—all three are valid)

### Pattern 3: "None of the Above"

**Format:** Options A, B, C + "D) None of the above"

**Strategy:**
1. This is usually a trap—verify each option carefully
2. If ONE option seems correct, "None of the above" is wrong
3. Only select "None" if you're certain all other options are incorrect

### Pattern 4: Calculation Questions

**Format:** "Calculate the..." with numerical answers

**Strategy:**
1. Write down the formula first
2. Identify the numbers from the question
3. Calculate step by step
4. Check if your answer matches an option
5. If it doesn't match, recheck your calculation

**Common Traps:**
- Using the wrong percentage (4% vs 0.25%)
- Forgetting to convert units (sqm vs sqft)
- Adding instead of subtracting

### Pattern 5: "MOST" or "BEST" Questions

**Format:** "Which is the MOST appropriate..." or "What is the BEST..."

**Strategy:**
1. Multiple options may be partially correct
2. Look for the MOST complete or appropriate answer
3. Consider context—what would a professional do?
4. The "best" answer addresses the specific situation

**Example:**

"Which valuation approach is MOST appropriate for a standard apartment?"
- A) Cost Approach (valid but not best for standard property)
- B) Income Approach (valid for investment focus)
- C) Sales Comparison Approach ✅ (MOST appropriate for standard residential)
- D) Replacement Approach (same as cost approach)

### Pattern 6: Sequence Questions

**Format:** "What is the FIRST step..." or "What comes AFTER..."

**Strategy:**
1. Know the process sequences (transfer, registration, etc.)
2. Draw a mental timeline
3. Identify what happens before and after

### Pattern 7: Exception Questions

**Format:** "Which is NOT..." or "All EXCEPT..."

**Strategy:**
1. These are inverted questions—find the WRONG option
2. Read carefully—it's easy to select a correct option by mistake
3. Mark the question clearly to remind yourself of the inversion

## True/False Strategy Deep Dive

### Absolute Words = Usually False

| Word | Tendency |
|------|----------|
| Always | Usually FALSE |
| Never | Usually FALSE |
| All | Usually FALSE |
| None | Usually FALSE |
| Only | Usually FALSE |
| Must | Usually TRUE (for legal requirements) |

### Qualified Statements = Usually True

| Phrase | Tendency |
|--------|----------|
| Usually | Usually TRUE |
| Generally | Usually TRUE |
| May | Usually TRUE |
| Often | Usually TRUE |
| Sometimes | Usually TRUE |

### Example Analysis

**Statement:** "All property transfers require a 4% fee."

- Word "All" suggests FALSE
- But this IS true—4% is mandatory
- **Lesson:** Use the rule as a guide, but verify with your knowledge

---

## "All of the Above" Deep Analysis

### When "All of the Above" is Likely Correct

1. When A, B, and C are all clearly correct
2. When the question asks for "characteristics" or "features"
3. When options are complementary, not contradictory

### When "All of the Above" is Likely Wrong

1. When options contradict each other
2. When one option is clearly wrong
3. When options are mutually exclusive

### Strategy If Unsure

If you know:
- **2 options are correct** → "All of the above" is likely correct
- **1 option is wrong** → "All of the above" is definitely wrong
- **1 option is correct** → Need to evaluate other options

---

## Calculation Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach

**Step 1: Identify the calculation type**
- DLD fees (4%, 0.25%)
- Area conversion (10.76)
- Service charge (including 25% balcony)
- Yield calculation

**Step 2: Write down the formula**
- Don't try to calculate mentally
- Use scratch paper provided

**Step 3: Extract numbers from question**
- Property value
- Loan amount
- Areas (sqm or sqft)
- Rates

**Step 4: Calculate systematically**
- One step at a time
- Write intermediate results

**Step 5: Verify your answer**
- Does it match an option?
- Is it reasonable?
- Double-check if time permits

### Common Calculation Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Wrong percentage | Using 4% for mortgage reg | Mortgage = 0.25% |
| Wrong conversion | sqm × 9.29 | Correct: sqm × 10.76 |
| Forgot balcony rule | Full rate for balcony | Balcony = 25% rate |
| Net vs Gross | Not deducting expenses | Net = Rent - Expenses |

## Managing Difficult Questions

### The Skip Strategy

**When you encounter a difficult question:**

1. **Read it once** — Get the general idea
2. **Quick assessment** — Do you know the topic?
3. **If no** — Flag and skip immediately
4. **If yes but complex** — Flag and skip for later
5. **If yes and straightforward** — Answer now

### The Return Strategy

**When reviewing flagged questions:**

1. Re-read the question carefully
2. Eliminate obviously wrong options
3. Use educated guessing if needed
4. Never leave questions unanswered

### Educated Guessing

**If you must guess:**

1. Eliminate options you know are wrong
2. Look for answer patterns:
   - Middle numbers are often correct in calculations
   - Specific amounts are more likely than rounded numbers
3. Trust your first instinct if you've narrowed to two options

## Practice Questions

### Question 1

You've spent 3 minutes on a complex calculation question without reaching an answer. What should you do?

- A) Continue until you solve it
- B) Guess immediately and move on
- C) Flag the question and return later
- D) Skip without answering

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C) Flag the question and return later**

With 90 seconds per question, spending 3 minutes on one question takes time from others. Flag it, make your best guess if needed, and return during review time. Never leave questions unanswered.

</details>

### Question 2

A question asks "Which statement is TRUE?" and contains the word "always" in option B. What does this suggest?

- A) Option B is definitely correct
- B) Option B is likely incorrect
- C) The question is invalid
- D) All options should contain "always"

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B) Option B is likely incorrect**

Absolute words like "always," "never," "all," and "none" usually indicate false statements because they don't account for exceptions. However, always verify with your knowledge—some regulations are absolute.

</details>

### Question 3

You're choosing between options C and D. You're not sure which is correct. What's the best strategy?

- A) Always choose C
- B) Always choose D
- C) Go with your first instinct
- D) Skip the question

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C) Go with your first instinct**

Research shows your first instinct is correct more often than not. If you've eliminated A and B and are down to C and D, trust your initial reaction unless you have specific knowledge that changes your mind.

</details>

### Question 4

What should you do in the first 5 minutes of the exam?

- A) Start answering immediately
- B) Read instructions and calculate your pace
- C) Review all questions first
- D) Focus only on calculation questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B) Read instructions and calculate your pace**

Use the first few minutes to read instructions, note the total questions and time, and calculate your pace. This prevents surprises later and helps you manage time throughout the exam.

</details>

### Question 5

If a question asks "Which is NOT a requirement..." what type of answer are you looking for?

- A) The correct requirement
- B) The most important requirement
- C) The one that IS a requirement
- D) The one that IS NOT a requirement

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D) The one that IS NOT a requirement**

"NOT" questions are inverted—you're looking for the exception or incorrect option. Read these carefully; many candidates select a correct requirement when the question asks for what IS NOT required.

</details>
