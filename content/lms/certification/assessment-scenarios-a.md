## Scenario 1: Discovery — The End-User Buyer (DS-01)

**Source:** Discovery Scenarios > DS-01  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Needs analysis, family dynamics

### Setup Brief

> "You'll be speaking with Michael Torres, a Spanish banking executive relocating to Dubai with his family. He needs to find a family home in the next 6 weeks. This is a discovery conversation."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Client Focus | Do they ask about all family members? Wife, children? |
| Communication | Clear questions, not interrogation? |
| Market Knowledge | Know family-friendly areas and school options? |
| Process | Understand relocation timeline pressures? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they ask about the wife's priorities?** Many trainees focus only on Michael. A good consultant asks: "What's important to your wife in the move?"

2. **Do they ask about the children?** There are two children with different ages and needs. Do they understand this affects school and area choices?

3. **Do they establish budget AND timeline?** Both matter here — he's under time pressure.

4. **Do they suggest appropriate areas?** Family-friendly communities like Arabian Ranches, Dubai Hills? Not just investor-favourite areas.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Michael:**
- You're organized, methodical, used to structured processes
- You value your wife Ana's input — won't decide without her
- Your son Carlos (14) needs a British curriculum school
- Your daughter Sofia (10) is into swimming and tennis
- You're worried about making a wrong choice under time pressure

**Hidden concerns to reveal if prompted:**
- What if the assignment ends early? Can you sell easily?
- Is freehold secure for foreigners?
- Will this feel like home, not just an investment?

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Volunteer family information readily
- Higher: Share family details only when specifically asked

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Discovers family needs, asks about both children, understands timeline, suggests 2-3 appropriate areas
- **Concern signals:** Rushes to property recommendations, ignores family members, only talks about investment metrics

## Scenario 2: Objections — The Bubble Concern (OB-01)

**Source:** Objection Scenarios > OB-01  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Market knowledge, handling data requests

### Setup Brief

> "You're now Stephen Grant, a British pension fund analyst. You're interested in Dubai property but concerned it's a bubble waiting to burst. You've seen headlines about rapid price increases."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Market Knowledge | Can they discuss market cycles with data? |
| Composure | Do they get defensive when challenged? |
| Communication | Do they acknowledge valid concerns? |
| Client Focus | Do they understand his professional context? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they acknowledge the concern is valid?** The bubble concern is reasonable. Dismissing it is a red flag.

2. **Can they discuss 2008-2009 with specifics?** What caused it? What's different now? Trainees should know this.

3. **Do they provide data, not just reassurance?** Statements like "the market is strong" without evidence don't satisfy this client.

4. **Do they acknowledge remaining risks?** Honest assessment includes what could go wrong.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Stephen:**
- You're a professional skeptic — 25 years analyzing markets
- You saw 2008 happen, know what bubbles look like
- You want data, not sales pitch
- You have colleagues who lost money in Dubai before

**Questions to ask:**
- "How is this different from 2008?"
- "What's driving current price increases?"
- "What would you say to someone who bought at the peak in 2008?"
- "What happens to my investment if prices drop 30%?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Accept reasonable explanations, don't push hard
- Higher: Challenge every claim, ask for sources, be more skeptical

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Acknowledges valid concern, provides specific market context (supply constraints, regulatory changes, buyer profile shift), discusses risks honestly
- **Concern signals:** Gets defensive, dismisses concern, makes claims without data, can't discuss 2008 with specifics

## Scenario 3: Presentation — Off-Plan Walkthrough (PR-01)

**Source:** Presentation Scenarios > PR-01  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Product knowledge, explaining processes

### Setup Brief

> "You're Richard Clarke, a British business owner. You already own a ready property in Dubai Marina. Now you're considering your first off-plan purchase but you're nervous about paying for something that doesn't exist yet."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Process Expertise | Can they explain off-plan clearly? |
| Communication | Do they make complex topics simple? |
| Market Knowledge | Know payment structures, timelines? |
| Client Focus | Address his specific concerns? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they explain escrow protection?** This is fundamental to off-plan confidence. They should know how money is protected.

2. **Can they walk through payment milestones?** Booking, construction payments, handover — clear explanation needed.

3. **Do they address show flat vs reality?** This is a common concern — good consultants acknowledge possible differences.

4. **Do they give realistic timeline expectations?** Not just developer promises, but realistic delivery expectations.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Richard:**
- You understand ready property well — did it 3 years ago
- Off-plan feels risky to you
- You've heard about payment plans, want to understand them
- Main concerns: what if developer goes bust? What if it looks nothing like the show flat?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What happens to my money if the developer goes bankrupt?"
- "How do I know the finished product will look like the show flat?"
- "What are my rights if the project is delayed?"
- "Can you explain the payment plan step by step?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Accept clear explanations readily
- Higher: Ask more detailed follow-up questions, express continued skepticism

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Explains escrow clearly, walks through payment plan, addresses show flat concerns honestly, sets realistic timeline expectations
- **Concern signals:** Can't explain escrow, vague on payment structure, overpromises on quality match or timeline

## Scenario 4: Closing — EOI Commitment (CL-01)

**Source:** Closing Scenarios > CL-01  
**Duration:** 8-10 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Process expertise, moving to action

### Setup Brief

> "You're Richard Thompson, a British private equity executive. You've done your research, seen the property twice, your wife is on board. You're ready to proceed. You just need clear guidance on the next steps."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Process Expertise | Do they know EOI process cold? |
| Communication | Clear and efficient delivery? |
| Composure | Confident without being pushy? |
| Client Focus | Responsive to what you need? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Is the EOI explanation clear and simple?** This should be second nature. Fumbling here is a significant concern.

2. **Do they explain what EOI commits him to?** Is it refundable? What are the next steps after?

3. **Do they handle documents and payment clearly?** What's needed, how much, to whom?

4. **Do they set timeline expectations?** What happens next, and when?

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Richard:**
- You're ready to proceed — not stalling
- You want efficiency and clarity
- You're used to business transactions, expect professionalism
- If the process is clear, you'll move forward happily

**Questions to ask:**
- "What exactly is an EOI?"
- "How much is the booking amount?"
- "Is the booking amount refundable?"
- "What documents do you need from me?"
- "When do I sign the actual agreement?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Be ready to proceed, don't complicate
- Higher: Ask more detailed process questions, probe for full understanding

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Explains EOI clearly, knows amounts and documents needed, sets clear next steps, makes process feel simple
- **Concern signals:** Unsure about EOI process, vague on amounts or documents, makes process feel complicated

**Source:** Difficult Situations Scenarios > DS-03  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Composure, bad news delivery

### Setup Brief

> "You're now a client who bought off-plan through this consultant 18 months ago. You expected delivery in 6 months. The consultant is calling to tell you there's a 6-month delay. The property won't be ready for another 12 months."

1. **Do they deliver the news directly?** No burying or spinning. Direct but empathetic.

2. **Do they acknowledge your frustration?** Validation before problem-solving is essential.

3. **Do they explain options?** What can you do? What are your rights?

4. **Do they commit to ongoing support?** This isn't the end of the conversation.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Choose a persona (pick one):**
- **A) Angry investor:** Financial stretched, furious, needs to vent
- **B) Calm professional:** Wants facts and solutions, not emotions
- **C) First-time buyer:** Panicking, questioning everything

**Questions to ask:**

- "What compensation is the developer offering?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
