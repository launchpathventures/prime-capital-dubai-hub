## Trakheesi: Advertising Permits

### What is Trakheesi?

| Social media posts (Instagram, Facebook) | Yes |
| WhatsApp broadcasts | Yes |
| Print advertisements | Yes |

| Email marketing | Yes |
| Website listings | Yes |

### Trakheesi Requirements

Every advertisement must display:
- Trakheesi permit number
- QR code linking to permit verification
- Broker name and broker card number
- Brokerage name and RERA registration

### How to Obtain Trakheesi

1. Log into RERA Broker Portal
2. Select property to advertise
3. Upload property details and images
4. Pay permit fee (varies by property)
5. Receive permit number and QR code

### Permit Validity

## Fines and Penalties

### Critical Numbers to Memorize

| Advertising without Trakheesi | **AED 50,000** |
| Employing unlicensed broker | **AED 100,000** |

### Penalty Escalation

| First offense | Warning + fine |
| Second offense | Double fine + mandatory training |
| Third offense | License suspension (30-90 days) |
| Fourth offense | License revocation |
| Criminal activity | Prosecution + permanent ban |

### License Suspension Triggers

Automatic suspension can result from:
- Outstanding fines unpaid for 30+ days
- Failure to maintain required insurance
- Criminal conviction
- Fraudulent transaction involvement
- Repeated advertising violations

---

## Escrow Account Regulations

### Purpose

Escrow accounts protect off-plan buyers by ensuring:
- Buyer funds used only for project construction
- Funds released only when milestones achieved
- Buyer refund possible if developer defaults

### Developer Requirements

Before selling off-plan units, developers must:
1. Register project with RERA
2. Open dedicated project escrow account
3. Demonstrate 20% project completion
4. Provide bank guarantee or insurance

### Fund Release Schedule

| Construction Milestone | Funds Released |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| 20% completion | First tranche |
| 40% completion | Second tranche |
| 60% completion | Third tranche |
| 80% completion | Fourth tranche |
| 100% completion | Final tranche |

### Broker Responsibility

Brokers must:
- Verify project is RERA-registered
- Ensure payments go to escrow account
- Never accept payments to personal/company accounts
- Provide escrow account details to buyers

**Exam Trap:** Any payment not going to the registered escrow account is a red flag and potential fraud indicator.

## Common Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unlicensed Activity

**Situation:** A property owner asks you to help sell their apartment. Your broker card expired last week while renewal is pending.

**Correct Answer:** You cannot facilitate any transactions until your card is renewed.

**Why:** Operating with an expired license is equivalent to operating without a license. Even "pending renewal" is not valid for transactions.

### Scenario 2: Advertisement Without Permit

**Situation:** A new listing comes in and the seller wants it marketed immediately. Your colleague suggests posting on Instagram while the Trakheesi permit is being processed.

**Correct Answer:** Wait for Trakheesi approval before any advertisement.

**Why:** Every property advertisement requires an active Trakheesi permit. "Pending" status does not authorize marketing.

### Scenario 3: Payment to Wrong Account

**Situation:** A developer asks you to collect the buyer's down payment into your brokerage's account to "speed up the process."

**Correct Answer:** Decline and ensure payment goes directly to the project's escrow account.

**Why:** Off-plan payments must go to registered escrow accounts. Accepting payments to any other account is a violation and potential fraud.

### Scenario 4: Complaint Response

**Situation:** Your brokerage receives an RVS complaint. The operations manager says to ignore it since the client's claims are false.

**Correct Answer:** Respond within 15 days with documentation refuting the claims.

**Why:** Failure to respond to RVS complaints can result in default judgment against you. Always respond with evidence.
