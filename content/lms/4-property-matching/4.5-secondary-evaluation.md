# Secondary Market Evaluation

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **evaluate any secondary market property** using the Secondary Market Due Diligence Checklist and determine if the asking price represents fair value.

---

## What Is the Secondary Market?

The secondary market refers to properties being resold — not purchased directly from developers. These are "ready" properties: completed, often already tenanted, with a track record you can evaluate.

Also called: resale market, ready market, existing properties.

## Why Consider Secondary Properties?

### Advantages

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Immediate income | Can be rented from day one — no waiting |
| Known performance | Actual rental history, not projections |
| What you see is what you get | No construction risk, no waiting |
| Established communities | Infrastructure, retail, transport in place |
| Negotiation opportunity | Individual sellers may be flexible on price |
| Due diligence clarity | Building management, service charges all known |
| Investment Score accuracy | Real data for yield calculations |

### Considerations

| Consideration | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| Higher entry price | Typically priced above off-plan equivalents |
| Less payment flexibility | Usually cash or mortgage, no staged payments |
| May need renovation | Older properties may require updating |
| Existing tenants | May need to honour lease or wait for vacancy |
| Limited availability | Can't always find exact spec in desired location |

## Evaluating Secondary Properties

### 1. Physical Condition

Unlike off-plan, you can inspect secondary properties. Do so thoroughly.

**What to check:**

- **Building common areas** — Lobby, corridors, gym, pool condition
- **Unit condition** — Flooring, paint, fixtures, appliances
- **HVAC** — Air conditioning units, age and maintenance
- **Windows and seals** — Any condensation, leaks, or damage
- **Plumbing** — Water pressure, drainage, any visible issues
- **Balcony/terrace** — Condition of outdoor space

**Red flags:**
- Deferred maintenance in common areas (suggests poor building management)
- Owner unwilling to allow thorough inspection
- Evidence of water damage or structural issues
- Outdated systems that will need replacement

### 2. Building Management

How well is the building managed? This affects ongoing experience and resale value.

**Questions to research:**

- Who manages the building? (Reputation matters)
- What are the service charges? (Get exact figures, not estimates)
- Are there any outstanding disputes or legal issues?
- What's the occupancy rate? (Low occupancy can indicate problems)
- Are there planned major works? (Could mean special levies)

### 3. Pricing Assessment

Is the asking price fair? Secondary pricing is negotiable — unlike developer prices.

**How to assess value:**

1. **Recent transactions** — What have similar units in the same building sold for?
2. **Current listings** — What else is available at what price?
3. **Price per square foot** — Compare to area averages
4. **Rental yield at asking price** — Does the return make sense?

**Worked example:**

**Property:** 2BR in Marina building  
**Asking price:** AED 2,200,000  
**Size:** 1,350 sqft  
**Price per sqft:** AED 1,630

**Comparables:**
- Unit 1805 (same building): Sold AED 2,050,000, 1,320 sqft = AED 1,553/sqft
- Unit 1206 (same building): Sold AED 2,180,000, 1,380 sqft = AED 1,580/sqft
- Unit 2003 (same building): Listed AED 2,150,000, 1,340 sqft = AED 1,604/sqft

**Assessment:** Asking price is approximately 3-5% above recent sales. There's negotiation room.

### 4. Seller Motivation

Understanding why someone is selling helps you assess value and negotiation potential.

**Common motivations:**

| Motivation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **Relocation** | Often motivated by timeline, may accept lower offers |
| **Upgrading/downsizing** | Depends on their purchase timing; may be flexible |
| **Investment exit** | Usually seeking specific return; price-focused |
| **Financial pressure** | Most motivated; may accept significant discount |
| **Estate sale** | Executors often want quick resolution |

**Questions to ask (tactfully):**

- "How long has the property been listed?"
- "Has the owner received any offers?"
- "Is there a timeline the owner is working to?"
- "What's the background to the sale?"

### 5. Rental Performance

If the property has been rented, get actual performance data.

**Request:**
- Current lease terms and rental amount
- Rental history (has it been continuously let?)
- Tenant payment history (any defaults?)
- When does the current lease expire?

**Why this matters:**

Actual rental data beats projections. A property with a consistent tenant at AED 120,000/year is more valuable than a similar property with estimated rent of AED 130,000 that's been vacant.

## Secondary vs. Off-Plan: Decision Framework

| Factor | Favours Secondary | Favours Off-Plan |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Immediate income needed | ✓ | |
| Risk tolerance | Lower risk ✓ | Higher risk acceptable |
| Capital availability | Full amount available | Wants staged payments ✓ |
| Time horizon | Short-term (1-3 years) ✓ | Long-term (5+ years) |
| Specific location | Must be in established area ✓ | Willing to consider emerging |
| Price priority | Willing to pay premium for certainty | Wants lowest entry point ✓ |
| Customisation | Accepts property as-is | Wants to select unit/floor ✓ |

## Presenting Secondary Opportunities

### Frame the Trade-off

**Don't say:** "This is better than off-plan because there's no risk."

**Do say:** "This property offers immediate rental income and certainty — you know exactly what you're getting. The trade-off is a higher entry price compared to off-plan, and you'd pay the full amount on transfer rather than staged payments."

### Use Actual Data

**Don't say:** "Similar properties rent for about 100,000."

**Do say:** "This unit has been rented continuously since 2019. The current tenant is paying AED 105,000 annually on a lease that expires in August. That's consistent with other 2-beds in this building."

### Address Condition Honestly

**Don't say:** "It's in good condition."

**Do say:** "The building common areas are well-maintained — the owners' association has a good reputation. The unit itself is original condition from 2017. The kitchen and bathrooms are functional but dated. If the investor wants to maximise rent, a refresh of AED 30-40,000 would bring it to current standards."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Secondary means certainty** — What you see is what you get, with real data for Investment Score
2. **Use the Due Diligence Checklist** — Systematic evaluation prevents overlooking issues
3. **Building management matters** — Affects ongoing experience, costs, and resale
4. **Pricing is negotiable** — Research comparables and seller motivation to find leverage
5. **Rental history is valuable** — Actual data beats projections every time
6. **Match to investor needs** — Use the decision framework to guide recommendations
