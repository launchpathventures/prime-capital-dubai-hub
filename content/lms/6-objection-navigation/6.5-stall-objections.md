## Introduction

"I need to think about it." "Let me discuss with my spouse." "Can we revisit this in 3-6 months?"

Stall and delay objections are frustrating because they're rarely the real issue. A client who says "I need to think about it" after seeing all the information usually has an unspoken concern they're not comfortable raising directly.

Your job is to create space for the real objection to surface, address it, and maintain momentum without being pushy.

This module teaches you to diagnose stall tactics, uncover hidden concerns, and move prospects forward professionally.

## The Five Types of Stall Objections

### 1. The Polite Brush-Off

**What they say:** "Let me think about it and get back to you"

**What it means:** Often "I'm not interested but don't want to say no directly"

**How to diagnose:** Low engagement throughout conversation, vague answers to questions, checking time repeatedly

### 2. The Information Overload Stall

**What they say:** "This is a lot to process—I need time to review everything"

**What it means:** Genuinely overwhelmed by information, not sure how to evaluate

**How to diagnose:** They seemed engaged but confused, asked good questions but struggled to synthesize

### 3. The Hidden Objection Stall

**What they say:** "I need to discuss with my wife/advisor/partner"

**What it means:** There's a specific concern they're not comfortable raising

**How to diagnose:** Seems interested but deflects when asked about concerns

### 4. The Comparison Shopping Stall

**What they say:** "I want to look at a few more options before deciding"

**What it means:** Either genuinely comparing OR avoiding decision

**How to diagnose:** Asks detailed questions, takes notes, but non-committal on next steps

### 5. The Timing/Authority Stall

**What they say:** "Now's not the right time" OR "I need my partner's approval first"

**What it means:** Lack of urgency or unclear decision authority

**How to diagnose:** Interested in property but vague on timeline or decision process

## Coach Walkthrough: The "I Need to Think About It" Stall

<speak>
This is the objection every consultant dreads. You've spent 90 minutes presenting properties, answering questions, building rapport—then: "I need to think about it." Most consultants accept this and schedule a follow-up, only to chase the prospect for weeks with no response.

Watch how we uncover the real objection underneath.
</speak>

**Prospect:** "This all looks interesting. Let me think about it over the weekend and I'll get back to you next week."

**Consultant:** "Absolutely—this is a significant decision and you should feel comfortable with it. Before we wrap up, can I ask: of everything we discussed today, what's the one thing you're most uncertain about?"

<speak>
I've acknowledged their need for time, then immediately asked a diagnostic question. This gives them permission to voice the real concern.
</speak>

**Prospect:** "Well... I guess I'm still not 100% sure about the developer's track record."

**Consultant:** "That's important to address. We looked at Emaar's delivery history—81% on-time over 10 years. Is there a specific aspect of their track record that concerns you, or is it more general uncertainty about off-plan construction in Dubai?"

<speak>
The prospect just revealed the real objection: trust objection about the developer. This is completely addressable—I can provide more evidence, arrange a site visit, or offer references. But if I'd accepted "let me think about it," I would never have known this was the blocker.
</speak>

**Prospect:** "I guess I'm just nervous about committing to something that won't be ready for 3 years. What if something goes wrong?"

**Consultant:** "That's a fair concern, and I'd rather address it now than have you worry about it all weekend. Let me show you three things:

1. The RERA escrow protection specific to this project—your funds are protected even if something goes wrong
2. Emaar's delivery record—not just percentages but actual projects you can verify
3. A reference call with one of our clients who bought off-plan from Emaar 2 years ago and just took handover

Would spending 15 more minutes on this help you feel more confident, or do you still need the weekend to process?"

<speak>
Now I've given them a choice: address it now or take time. But I've also shown I'm responsive to their real concern, not pushing them to decide. Often, they'll engage immediately because the real objection is now on the table.
</speak>

**Prospect:** "Actually, yes—if you have time now, I'd like to see the escrow details and maybe talk to your other client."

<speak>
The stall just converted to active engagement. This happens when you uncover and address the hidden objection rather than accepting the surface-level delay.
</speak>

## The Diagnostic Question Framework

When you hear a stall, use these questions to uncover the real issue:

### "What's the one thing you're most uncertain about?"

**When to use:** After generic "let me think about it"

**Why it works:** Gives permission to voice specific concern without pressure

### "On a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in this property?"

**When to use:** When you sense interest but can't gauge level

**Why it works:** The number tells you if it's real interest (7+) or polite brush-off (1-4)

**Follow-up:** "What would it take to get from a 7 to a 9?"

### "Is there something specific you want to think about, or do you need time to process everything?"

**When to use:** After information-heavy presentation

**Why it works:** Distinguishes information overload from hidden objection

### "What would need to happen for you to move forward with this?"

**When to use:** When timeline is vague

**Why it works:** Forces articulation of decision criteria

### "Have I given you everything you need to make this decision, or is there something missing?"

**When to use:** When conversation feels complete but no commitment

**Why it works:** Identifies information gaps OR reveals they need something else (e.g., partner buy-in)

## Stall Objection Response Scripts

### "I need to think about it"

<details>
<summary>Full Response Script</summary>

**Acknowledge:** "Absolutely—you should feel 100% confident before moving forward with a decision of this size."

**Diagnose:** "Can I ask: is there something specific you want to think through, or do you need time to process all the information we've covered?"

**[If specific concern]:**
"Would it help if we addressed that now? I'd rather make sure you have what you need than have you spend the weekend uncertain about something I can clarify."

**[If need to process]:**
"That makes sense—we covered a lot today. How about I send you a summary of the key points we discussed, plus the documents on developer track record and payment plan. Would Tuesday work for a quick call to answer any questions that come up as you review?"

**[If polite brush-off detected]:**
"I appreciate your time today. Just so I understand—are you genuinely interested in this property but need more time, or are we not quite aligned on what you're looking for? I'm happy either way, but I want to make sure I'm respecting your time."

</details>

### "I need to discuss with my spouse/partner"

<details>
<summary>Full Response Script</summary>

**Acknowledge:** "That makes complete sense—a decision like this should be made together."

**Facilitate:** "Would it be helpful if your spouse joined us for a brief call or meeting? I can walk through the property details, answer any questions they have, and make sure you're both comfortable with the numbers. That way you can have an informed discussion."

**Alternative:** "Or if they prefer to review independently, I can send over a complete information packet—property details, payment plan, cost breakdown, developer track record—everything in one place. What works better?"

**Check Authority:** "Just to understand the decision process: once you've discussed, do you both need to see the property in person, or is there anything else required before moving forward?"

<speak>
The key is offering to facilitate rather than accepting the delay as a blocker. Many "I need to discuss with spouse" stalls are actually hidden objections the prospect isn't comfortable raising.
</speak>

### "This isn't the right time—maybe in 6 months"

<details>
<summary>Full Response Script</summary>

**Acknowledge:** "Timing is important—you want to invest when it makes sense for your situation."

**Explore:** "Can I ask what changes in 6 months that makes it better timing? Is it financial readiness, market conditions, or something else?"

**[If financial]:**
"Would it help to structure around your timeline? Many off-plan properties have payment plans that spread installments over 2-3 years. You could secure the property now at today's price with minimal upfront capital, then larger payments align with when you're ready."

**[If market timing]:**
"I understand wanting to time the market. Let me show you what historically happens in Dubai when people wait. [Shows data on price appreciation]. The cost of waiting 6 months—in foregone rent and potential price increases—often exceeds any savings from trying to time a dip. But I won't pressure you—let me send you the data and we can reconnect in a few months if that's what makes sense for you."

**[If vague]:**
"I appreciate the honesty. It sounds like this might not be the right fit right now. Would it help if I checked in quarterly with market updates, or would you prefer to reach out when the timing is better?"

<speak>
With timing objections, either you uncover a real constraint you can work around, or you identify that they're not serious buyers. Either outcome is valuable—you're not wasting time chasing someone who won't transact.
</speak>

</details>

### "I want to look at a few more options"

<details>
<summary>Full Response Script</summary>

**Acknowledge:** "Smart approach—you want to make sure you've seen the best options before deciding."

**Clarify:** "Can I ask what specifically you're hoping to find that this property doesn't offer? Is it price, location, layout, amenities, or something else? That helps me understand if there are other properties I should show you, or if we're already looking at the right one."

**[If legitimate comparison]:**
"That makes sense. Here's what I'd recommend: let me show you the 2-3 properties that most closely match what you're looking for, we do a side-by-side comparison, and then you make an informed decision. Does that work?"

**[If avoiding decision]:**
"I appreciate you being thoughtful about this. Just to level with you: are you genuinely comparing options, or is there something about this property or process that doesn't feel right? I'd rather know now so I can address it or point you in a better direction."

<speak>
Comparison shopping can be legitimate due diligence OR a polite brush-off. Your job is to distinguish between them. If it's legitimate, facilitate the comparison professionally. If it's avoidance, create space for the real objection to surface.
</speak>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Wrong: Accepting Stalls Without Diagnosis

"Okay, no problem—I'll follow up next week!"

**Why it fails:** You never uncover the real objection. Follow-up calls go unreturned. Deal dies slowly.

### ✅ Right: Gentle Diagnosis Before Moving On

"Before we wrap up, can I ask: what's the one thing you're most uncertain about? I'd rather address it now than have you spend days thinking about something I can clarify."

---

### ❌ Wrong: Pressuring for Immediate Decision

"This price is only available today—you need to decide now."

**Why it fails:** High-pressure tactics backfire with sophisticated investors. Even if true, sounds manipulative.

### ✅ Right: Creating Urgency Through Information

"I don't want to pressure you, but I should mention: this developer typically adjusts pricing after selling 50% of inventory. They're at 42% now. If this is the right property for you, locking in now protects you from a price increase. But that's a data point, not a pressure tactic."

---

### ❌ Wrong: Chasing Indefinitely Without Qualification

Sending "just checking in" messages every week for 2 months with no response.

**Why it fails:** Wastes your time. Makes you seem desperate.

### ✅ Right: Setting Follow-Up Expectations

"I'll send over the information we discussed. If I don't hear from you by Wednesday, I'll assume the timing isn't right and I won't keep bothering you. But I'm here if questions come up."

## Why Stall Objections Matter

Handling stall objections effectively enables you to:

1. **Uncover real concerns** that can be addressed, rather than accepting surface-level delays
2. **Maintain deal momentum** without high-pressure tactics that damage trust
3. **Qualify prospects accurately** so you focus time on serious buyers
4. **Increase conversion rates** by addressing hidden objections before they become deal-killers
5. **Reduce time waste** by identifying early when prospects aren't serious

Most deals don't die from objections—they die from stalls that hide unaddressed objections. Your ability to diagnose and resolve these determines your conversion rate.

## Key Takeaways

- "I need to think about it" is rarely the real objection—it's a symptom of a hidden concern
- Use diagnostic questions to uncover the specific issue: "What's the one thing you're most uncertain about?"
- Stalls fall into five types: polite brush-off, information overload, hidden objection, comparison shopping, and timing/authority issues
- Offer to facilitate partner discussions rather than accepting delay as blocker
- Set follow-up expectations clearly—don't chase prospects indefinitely without requalification
- Create space for the real objection to surface without applying pressure
