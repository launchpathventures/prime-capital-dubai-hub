# Catalyst — Project Voice Guide (v2)

## 1. Purpose & Context

This document defines **how Catalyst should sound**.

It exists to help:
- Delivery leads and partner agencies explain Catalyst clearly (without technical jargon)
- Teams write documentation and proposals that build trust fast
- AI and technical builders generate copy that matches the Catalyst voice

Catalyst is an AI-first delivery methodology + development kit for shipping production-ready outcomes in **weeks, not months**.

The central message Catalyst communicates is simple:

> AI collapses build time. **Speed isn’t the problem — drift is.** Catalyst keeps delivery aligned while you build fast.

This guide is intentionally practical. It is not a full brand strategy document.

---

## 2. Audience & Communication Goals

### Primary audience
**Pioneering Catalyst devs**: partner agencies, enterprise delivery leads, and teams responsible for outcomes.

They want:
- clarity (what it is, why it matters, how to run it)
- trust (this is grounded in real delivery)
- momentum (a path to start immediately)

### Secondary audience
**AI and technical builders** who implement the kit.

They want:
- consistent terminology
- clear guidance on what to do next
- predictable patterns

### Communication goals (in order)
1) Make the approach feel **runnable**
2) Make the value feel **real**
3) Make the boundaries feel **safe**
4) Make the technical details feel **available, not dominant**

---

## 3. Voice (How We Sound)

### English & regional conventions
- Write in **UK English suitable for New Zealand**.
- Prefer plain, familiar words over US or overly technical alternatives.
- Use short, purposeful sentences. Avoid corporate waffle.

### Voice traits
- **Confident and grounded**: we speak from delivery experience, not theory.
- **Direct and practical**: we say what to do, not what to believe.
- **Human-first**: we lead with outcomes and reality, not taxonomy.
- **Calm authority**: no hype, no defensiveness.
- **Respectfully opinionated**: we provide strong defaults and invite intentional overrides.

### What we optimise for
- **Outcome first:** lead with what this solves.
- **Trust second:** show that it’s safe and repeatable.
- **Mechanism third:** explain how it works in human terms.
- **Technical last:** details are available, not dominant.

### What we avoid
- Marketing hyperbole (“revolutionary”, “game-changing”, “unprecedented”)
- Fear-based selling (“you will fail without…”) 
- Technical-first framing as the opening move (“Next.js App Router…”) 
- Over-caveating (“results may vary” energy) in primary messaging
- Internal jargon as headlines ("quality bars", "stacks") unless introduced gently

### Voice checklist (quick test)
A piece of Catalyst comms should feel like:
- a trusted delivery lead explaining the method
- focused on outcomes and decisions
- easy to repeat to someone else

## 4. The Catalyst Message Spine (What We Always Mean)

Use this spine to keep messaging consistent across docs, landing pages, presentations, and internal comms.

### The core story
1) **Reality:** AI has collapsed build time.
2) **Problem:** Faster build increases drift.
3) **Answer:** Catalyst keeps intent anchored while you move fast.
4) **Mechanism:** Proof-led steering + durable decisions + staged path to production.
5) **Outcome:** Weeks, not months — without accidental production.

### The practical punchline
Catalyst replaces long translation loops with a repeatable rhythm:

- get clear on intent
- build a proof quickly
- review live with stakeholders
- advance what's proven

### Canonical one-liner (default)
Catalyst is the AI-first way to ship production-ready outcomes in weeks instead of months — by keeping teams aligned while AI helps them build fast.

### Canonical “why now” line
Speed isn’t the problem — drift is. Catalyst makes fast delivery steerable.

---

## 5. Language Rules (Words We Use)

### Lead with human words
Prefer:
- **checkpoints** (natural part of each delivery phase)
- **delivery stages** (instead of "quality bars")
- **proof / credible proof** (instead of "prototype")
- **live review** (instead of "stakeholder alignment meeting")
- **advancement** (proof → product → production)

The delivery phases (Brief, Build, Review, Refine) are already human-friendly terms.

### Keep the promises concrete
Say:
- “Catalyst can help turn a 4-month project into ~2 weeks.”
- “We’ve shipped proofs in hours when scope is tight.”

Then immediately ground it in what makes that possible:
- “Because we steer on working proof and keep decisions durable.”

### Define “Catalyst dev” consistently
A **Catalyst dev** is not just a coder using AI.
A Catalyst dev is someone who can run:
- proof-led delivery
- decision capture
- staged promotion toward production

### How we name the relationship to RIVER
- RIVER Group created Catalyst through real delivery.
- Catalyst can be used as **managed delivery** (with RIVER) or **DIY** (with this kit + method).
- These docs are written for the **DIY Catalyst dev**, but should still feel enterprise-grade and trustworthy.

---

## 6. Claims & Proof (How We Talk About Outcomes)

### The rule
We speak confidently about outcomes **as a result of the method**, not as magic.

### Approved proof patterns
- “Built by RIVER Group on real delivery. Proven with partner agencies.”
- “We’ve repeatedly collapsed delivery cycles from months to weeks.”
- “When scope is focused, we can produce credible proof extremely quickly.”

### The trust pattern (recommended)
When making a bold claim, follow this structure:

1) **Outcome:** what’s possible (weeks, not months)
2) **Reason:** why it’s possible (proof-led steering + durable decisions)
3) **Boundary:** what keeps it safe (staged promotion; no accidental production)

### Avoid
- Over-technical proof (“we used Next.js 16 and Tailwind 4…”) as the headline
- Defensive hedging as the first sentence

---

## 7. Structure Templates (How We Write)

### Template A — Overview (short)
- **What it is:** one sentence
- **Why it exists:** drift problem in one paragraph
- **How it works:** 3–5 bullets (human terms)
- **What you get:** weeks not months, safe path to production
- **How to start:** two options (fast start vs intent-first)

### Template B — A page or section that teaches something
- **2-minute summary**
- **What changes when you do this**
- **How to run it (steps)**
- **Common drift patterns (pitfalls)**
- **Next step (single link/action)**

### Template C — A meeting or ritual
- **Purpose**
- **Who’s in the room**
- **Agenda**
- **Decisions to force**
- **Outputs (what gets written down)**

### Template D — A “start here” CTA block
- **If you need speed today:** start proof-first (clone the kit, build the proof)
- **If you need clarity first:** start intent-first (Vision/Architecture/PRD, then build)
- End with a single next step: “Choose one path and begin.”

## 8. Examples (Approved Copy)

### Example 1 — Catalyst definition (docs / landing)
Catalyst is an AI-first delivery methodology and development kit that helps teams ship production-ready outcomes in weeks instead of months.

It’s built for the AI era: when building is fast, the real risk is drift. Catalyst keeps intent anchored through proof-led steering and durable decisions — so you can move quickly without turning a prototype into accidental production.

### Example 2 — Partner agency framing
Catalyst gives agencies a repeatable way to deliver high-velocity projects with AI — without relying on hero leads or losing context between phases. It replaces long translation loops with working proof and clear decision moments.

### Example 3 — Enterprise delivery framing
Catalyst is designed for teams who need speed *and* control. It makes delivery steerable: stakeholders see working proof early, decisions are captured as they’re made, and production readiness is a deliberate promotion — not an accident.

## 9. Language Library (Reusable Phrases)

Use these phrases to keep Catalyst comms consistent.

### Core phrases
- “Results in weeks, not months.”
- “Speed isn’t the problem — drift is.”
- “Proof-led delivery: steer on the real thing.”
- “Decisions that stick.”
- “Prove value fast, then scale safely.”
- “A repeatable rhythm, not hero-led delivery.”

### Value & outcomes
- “Reduce rework by steering earlier.”
- “Collapse translation loops.”
- “Keep delivery aligned as speed increases.”
- “Graduate from proof to production deliberately.”

### Trust & safety (Catalyst-specific)
- “Production is a choice, not an accident.”
- “POC-safe by default, production by promotion.”
- “Strong defaults you can override intentionally.”

---

## 10. Conversational Moves (How We Progress Conversations)

These patterns help Catalyst comms stay direct, helpful, and forward-moving.

### Outcome-first openers
- “Here’s what this solves.”
- “Here’s what we can prove in a week.”
- “Here’s how we keep speed steerable.”

### Questions that reduce uncertainty
- “What does a credible proof look like for you?”
- “Who needs to be confident before we move forward?”
- “What decisions do we need by Friday?”
- “What would make this a clear yes/no after the first proof sprint?”

### Short closers / CTAs
- “Start small, scale safely.”
- “Prove value, then advance.”
- “Let’s align intent, then build the proof.”

---

## 11. Visual Guidance (Expressed in Words)

Catalyst communication should look like it sounds: clear, confident, and runnable.

### Layout rules
- Start with a **2-minute summary** on key pages
- Use short sections with clear headings
- Prefer checklists and steps over long prose
- Keep pages scannable: avoid dense blocks of text
- Hide deep technical detail behind clearly labeled sections

### Visual tone
- Calm and minimal
- Proof-led: show the thing, don’t over-explain it
- Consistent hierarchy: headline → short paragraph → bullets

---

## 12. How to Use This Guide

When writing any Catalyst comms (docs, landing pages, presentations, in-product copy):

1) Start from the **message spine** (Section 4)
2) Use human-first terms (Section 5)
3) Keep the tone confident and grounded (Section 3)
4) Use a structure template (Section 7)
5) Re-run the voice checklist: does this feel runnable and trustworthy?

If an AI agent is writing:
- Give it the message spine (Section 4)
- Tell it which audience it’s for (Section 2)
- Require UK/NZ English and the voice traits (Section 3)
- Ask it to reuse phrases from the language library (Section 9)

## Maintaining this doc

This Voice Guide should be stable. Update it when you see repeated tone drift across outputs or when the audience / message spine changes — not for one-off copy tweaks.
