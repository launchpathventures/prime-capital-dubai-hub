Investors speak numbers. They're comparing you to every other agent they've spoken with, and Dubai to every other market they're considering. Generic pitches don't work. Cookie-cutter yield promises don't work. What works is demonstrating that you understand their specific investment thesis.

Here's the framework.

Start with investment objectives, not budget. What does success look like—yield, growth, or both? What returns would make Dubai compelling versus their alternatives?

Understand their portfolio context. Is this diversification from a concentrated home market? Currency hedge? Tax efficiency play? Dubai fits differently for different investors.

Assess sophistication honestly. First-time international investors need education. Experienced allocators want analysis, not basics. Misjudging this loses credibility instantly.

Surface concerns proactively. Market timing worries. Off-plan construction risk. Liquidity questions. Better to address these in discovery than have them kill the deal later.

Timeline and decision process matter. Are they sole decision-makers? Is there a committee? What needs to happen for them to move forward?

Investors respect efficiency and expertise. Your discovery should demonstrate both while uncovering the specific criteria that will guide your recommendations.
