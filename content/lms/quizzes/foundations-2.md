## Questions

### Question 1
**What is the recommended time for your morning CRM review?**

A) 5:00 - 5:30 AM  
B) 7:00 - 7:30 AM  
C) 9:00 - 9:30 AM  
D) Whenever you have time during the day  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The Prime Capital morning routine recommends 7:00 - 7:30 AM for CRM review and planning. This happens after physical preparation but before checking messages, ensuring you start the day proactively.

---

### Question 2
**When should you check your WhatsApp and email messages in the morning routine?**

A) First thing when you wake up  
B) During breakfast  
C) After CRM review and planning (around 7:30 AM)  
D) Not until 10:00 AM  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Messages should be checked AFTER you've completed your CRM review and planning. Checking messages first makes your day reactive instead of proactive.

---

### Question 3
**What is the "2-minute rule" in productivity?**

A) Respond to all messages within 2 minutes  
B) Take a 2-minute break every hour  
C) If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately; if more, schedule it  
D) Complete your most important task in the first 2 minutes of the day  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The 2-minute rule states: If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. If it takes more than 2 minutes, schedule it properly. This prevents small tasks from piling up while also preventing important work from being done hastily.

---

### Question 4
**How often should you conduct a full pipeline review?**

A) Daily  
B) Weekly  
C) Monthly  
D) Only when a deal closes  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Weekly pipeline reviews (typically Monday morning or Friday end-of-week) are essential for identifying stuck deals, planning follow-ups, and maintaining pipeline health.

---

### Question 5
**What percentage of your day should ideally be proactive vs. reactive?**

A) 50% proactive, 50% reactive  
B) 90% proactive, 10% reactive  
C) 70% proactive, 30% reactive  
D) 30% proactive, 70% reactive  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The goal is 70% proactive (planned work based on your priorities) and 30% reactive (responding to incoming demands). This balance ensures important work happens while remaining responsive to clients.

---

### Question 6
**When is the best time block for "deep work" (focused, uninterrupted tasks)?**

A) 8:00 - 10:00 AM  
B) 12:00 - 2:00 PM (during lunch)  
C) 5:00 - 7:00 PM  
D) Late evening (9:00 - 11:00 PM)  

**Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Early morning (8:00 - 10:00 AM) is ideal for deep work because your mental energy is highest. This time should be protected for tasks requiring focus and quality thinking.

---

### Question 7
**When should you update your CRM after a client interaction?**

A) At the end of the day  
B) At the end of the week  
C) Immediately after the interaction  
D) Only if it was an important conversation  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** CRM should be updated immediately after every interaction. Waiting until later means you forget details, lose momentum, and often don't do it at all.

---

### Question 8
**What should you do with a deal that has had no activity for 7+ days during your pipeline review?**

A) Leave it alone — the client will reach out when ready  
B) Immediately mark it as lost  
C) Schedule follow-up, move to nurture, or mark as lost (depending on situation)  
D) Remove it from CRM to keep pipeline clean  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Deals with no activity need triage: schedule immediate follow-up (if viable), move to long-term nurture status, or honestly mark as lost. Leaving them in limbo clutters your pipeline and wastes mental energy.

---

### Question 9
**What is the recommended hard stop time for work each day?**

A) 8:00 PM  
B) 6:00 PM  
C) 10:00 PM  
D) No hard stop — work until everything is done  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** 6:00 PM is the recommended hard stop to maintain work-life boundaries. Real estate can consume your entire life if you let it. Boundaries are essential for long-term sustainability.

---

### Question 10
**Which of the following is an example of "batching similar tasks"?**

A) Checking email continuously throughout the day whenever a notification appears  
B) Checking email at three specific times: morning, midday, and end of day  
C) Responding to one email, then making a call, then updating CRM, then checking another email  
D) Doing whatever task feels most urgent in the moment  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Batching means grouping similar tasks together to minimize context-switching. Checking email at three designated times (instead of continuously) is a classic batching strategy that preserves focus and productivity.

## Implementation Challenge

Passing this quiz is one thing. Implementing these habits is what separates good intentions from real results.

**Your Challenge:**
- Follow the morning routine for 5 consecutive days
- Track your completion in a simple checklist
- Report to your manager or mentor at the end of the week

**Why This Matters:**
Knowledge without implementation is worthless. These habits compound over time — 90 days from now, you'll either have a healthy pipeline and sustainable workload, or you'll be overwhelmed and struggling.

The choice is yours.
