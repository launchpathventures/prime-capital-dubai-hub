### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

RERA regulations questions make up another quarter of your exam. These are often straightforward if you know the numbers — and completely impossible if you don't.

Let's start with the fines you must memorize. Operating without a broker license: fifty thousand dirhams. Advertising without Trakheesi: also fifty thousand. Employing an unlicensed broker: one hundred thousand. Operating an unregistered brokerage: five hundred thousand. These are tested repeatedly.

Trakheesi is RERA's advertising permit system. Every property advertisement in Dubai requires a permit — property portals, social media, WhatsApp broadcasts, email marketing. Everything. No exceptions for "just this one post."

The complaint process operates through RVS — the Real Estate Violations System. When a complaint is filed, the other party has fifteen days to respond. Fail to respond and you risk a default judgment.

Escrow accounts are mandatory for off-plan projects. All buyer payments must go directly to the registered escrow account — never to the developer's general account or the broker's account. That's a red flag and potential fraud indicator.

One more critical detail: your broker card expires annually. Operating with an expired license is the same as operating without one.
