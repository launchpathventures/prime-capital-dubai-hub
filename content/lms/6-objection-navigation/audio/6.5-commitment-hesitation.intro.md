"I need to think about it." "Send me the information and I'll review it." "Let me discuss with my partner." "I'll get back to you next month."

Stall objections are different from the others we've covered. Market objections, developer concerns, and price questions have substance—there's something concrete to address. Stall objections often lack substance. They're ways of ending a conversation without saying "no."

Behind these objections often lies a fear of commitment: "Making a decision feels risky, so I'll defer it." But there are other drivers—genuine need for time, unresolved concerns they haven't voiced, external factors, or polite rejection.

Your challenge is to distinguish between investors who genuinely need time and those who are declining politely. Push the first group, and you damage the relationship. Accept the second group's excuses indefinitely, and you waste time on deals that will never close.

In this module, you'll learn to diagnose what's really happening and respond appropriately. Let's see this in practice.
