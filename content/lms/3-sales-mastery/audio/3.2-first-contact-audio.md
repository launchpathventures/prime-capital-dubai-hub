MODULE 3.2: First Contact Excellence
TYPE: skills-script
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

The first sixty seconds of contact determine whether you earn a conversation or lose to a faster competitor.

When an investor submits an enquiry on Property Finder, that enquiry goes to three to five agents simultaneously. The buyer is often still browsing when your call comes in. The first professional response anchors their expectations — they mentally assign the opportunity to whoever responds first.

The data is clear: leads contacted under sixty seconds convert three times higher. After five minutes, conversion drops by eighty percent. After thirty minutes, someone else has already won.

This module gives you the exact scripts and systems for winning that critical window. You'll learn the primary portal lead response script, the "if they're busy" recovery script, and the website enquiry approach for higher-intent leads.

But speed alone isn't enough. You need speed combined with professionalism. A fast, generic response still loses to a thoughtful, personalised one — the goal is to be both fast AND good.

You'll also build your response system: notification setup, pre-prepared templates, calendar blocks for peak hours, and backup coverage when you're unavailable.

Master the sixty-second window, and you'll have more conversations than your competitors could ever dream of.

### DEMO (3-5 minutes)

**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of responding to a Property Finder portal lead. In both cases, an investor has just enquired about a two-bedroom apartment at a new Emaar development. Watch for the differences in timing, personalisation, and professionalism.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent receives notification, finishes current task, responds twelve minutes later]*

Agent: "Hi, thanks for your enquiry. Let me tell you about this amazing development — it has world-class amenities, a stunning pool, twenty-four-hour security, marble floors throughout, floor-to-ceiling windows, and the developer is very reputable."

*[Long pause — no response from lead]*

Agent: "Are you interested in scheduling a viewing? Let me know when you're free."

*[Another long pause]*

Agent: "Hello? Are you still there?"

Investor: "Sorry, I've actually already spoken to someone else about this."

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Went Wrong**

Four problems here. First, the twelve-minute response time — by then, at least two other agents had already made contact. Second, the generic opening — "thanks for your enquiry" says nothing about the specific property they asked about. Third, the feature dump — rattling off amenities without any context of what matters to THIS buyer. And fourth, asking for a viewing without any qualification — you don't know if they're even a real buyer yet.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent receives notification, responds within forty-five seconds]*

Agent: "Good afternoon, Ahmed! This is Sarah from Prime Capital. I noticed your enquiry about the two-bedroom at Creek Harbour Residences. Great choice — those units have been moving quickly, especially the ones with marina views. Are you free for a quick five-minute call now, or would you prefer I send some key details first?"

Investor: "I'm actually in a meeting right now."

Agent: "No problem at all — I appreciate you picking up. Just one quick question before I let you go: are you looking at this primarily as an investment or for personal use? That way, when we reconnect, I can share the most relevant options."

Investor: "Investment — rental yield is my main focus."

Agent: "Perfect. I'll send you a WhatsApp with my details. What time works better for you — morning or evening?"

Investor: "Evening, around seven."

Agent: "Great, I'll call you at seven this evening. Talk soon."

*[Immediately sends WhatsApp with contact details and confirms callback time]*

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Made It Work**

First, speed — forty-five seconds puts you first. Second, personalisation — using their name and the specific development they enquired about shows you're paying attention. Third, one piece of value — mentioning the marina views adds insight beyond what they already know. Fourth, offering choice — "call now or send details" respects their autonomy. And fifth, the busy recovery — when they couldn't talk, the agent got one qualifying answer and locked in a specific callback time. Even a thirty-second call can move a deal forward.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest difference? Speed plus personalisation. The strong example was fast AND showed they understood the specific enquiry. Anyone can respond quickly with a generic message. Winners respond quickly with something that demonstrates they're already thinking about the buyer's needs.
