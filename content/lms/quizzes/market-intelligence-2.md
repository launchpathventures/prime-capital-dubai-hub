- [ ] C) When 25% of units are sold

- [ ] B) 4-5%
- [x] C) 6-8%

### Question 4

**What is the purpose of Oqood registration?**

- [ ] A) Final title deed registration for ready properties
- [x] B) Recording buyer interest for off-plan properties before title deed issuance
- [ ] C) Registering rental contracts with the government
- [ ] D) Licensing real estate agents and brokers

**Explanation**: Oqood is the off-plan registration system that creates a legal record of the buyer's claim before the property is completed and a title deed can be issued. It protects buyers during the construction period.

### Question 5

**What happens to off-plan buyer payments if a developer goes bankrupt under current regulations?**

- [ ] A) Payments are lost with no recourse
- [ ] B) Buyers must sue the developer in court
- [x] C) Escrow funds remain protected and can be returned or used to complete the project
- [ ] D) The government automatically refunds all buyers

**Explanation**: Under current regulations, escrow funds are separate from developer assets. If a developer fails, RERA can assign the project to a new developer or return funds. While not automatic or instant, the escrow system provides significant protection.
