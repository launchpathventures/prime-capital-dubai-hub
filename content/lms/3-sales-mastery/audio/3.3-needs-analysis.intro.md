The needs analysis conversation determines everything that follows. Get this right, and you'll recommend the perfect property with confidence. Rush it, and you'll waste time showing unsuitable options.

Before presenting any property, you need to understand six key categories: motivation — why Dubai, why now, investment versus end-use. Budget — total capital, financing comfort, payment flexibility. Timeline — decision urgency, completion preferences. Criteria — location priorities, size requirements, must-haves versus nice-to-haves. Experience — first-time buyer or seasoned investor. And decision process — are they the sole decision-maker or is someone else involved?

Off-plan sales require deeper discovery because the buyer can't see the finished product. Payment plan structure affects affordability, completion timeline impacts planning, and ROI expectations need grounding in reality.

This module gives you the structured framework for discovery conversations. You'll learn to use the adapted SPIN model: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff questions specifically for real estate.

Here's the goal: ten minutes of discovery saves hours of wrong showings. The best salespeople listen seventy percent and talk only thirty percent.

Let's learn to ask better questions.
