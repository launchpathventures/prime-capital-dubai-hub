Welcome to Module 1.4: Off-Plan vs Ready Properties. This is one of the most common questions from new-to-Dubai investors, and your answer should never be generic. It depends entirely on the client's goals.

Here are the essentials:

First, understand the trade-offs. Off-plan offers lower entry pricing—10 to 30 percent below completion value—and payment plans spread over years. But it comes with delivery risk and no income until handover.

Second, ready properties offer certainty. You see exactly what you are buying, generate income immediately, and have full liquidity. But you pay current market rates with full capital deployment upfront.

Third, match to client profile. Long-term investors comfortable with risk lean toward off-plan. Income-focused or risk-averse clients lean toward ready. There is no universal answer.

Fourth, your role is guidance, not selling. Help clients understand the trade-offs—do not push them toward either option based on your commission preference.

Your key takeaway: The right answer is the one that fits the client's situation—not the one that generates the largest commission. This is how Prime Capital builds lasting relationships.
