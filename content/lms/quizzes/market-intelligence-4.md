- [ ] C) London yields are higher than Dubai
- [ ] D) Both markets have yields of 10%+

- [ ] C) Portugal requires EU citizenship to apply

- [x] A) Annual property tax (1-2% of value)

### Question 5

**When positioning Dubai to a skeptical London investor, which approach is most effective?**

- [ ] A) Criticize London's market performance and encourage them to sell all UK holdings
- [ ] B) Focus only on Dubai's advantages without acknowledging any limitations
- [x] C) Acknowledge London's strengths, present specific data on Dubai's advantages, and position Dubai as a portfolio addition
- [ ] D) Avoid comparisons entirely and focus only on property features

**Explanation**: Effective positioning respects the client's existing experience, uses specific data rather than generalizations, and positions Dubai as a complement to existing holdings rather than a complete replacement. This approach builds credibility and trust.
