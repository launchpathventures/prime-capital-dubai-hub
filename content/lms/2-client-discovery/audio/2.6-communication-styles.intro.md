Not every inquiry becomes a transaction. Not every transaction is worth pursuing. Qualification is how you determine whether a prospect is ready, able, and suitable for a purchase—and whether you're the right advisor for them.

BANT+ covers six dimensions.

Budget. Can they afford properties that meet their needs? Is their budget realistic? Do they understand total transaction costs?

Authority. Are they the decision-maker? Who else influences the decision? What's the approval process?

Need. Is there a genuine need driving the purchase? Is it urgent or exploratory? Will it persist long enough to complete a transaction?

Timeline. When do they need to complete? Is the timeline realistic? Are there external deadlines?

Plus Fit. Are they a good fit for our advisory approach? Do their values align with how we work?

Plus Capability. Can they logistically execute the transaction? Are there practical barriers?

Qualification protects everyone. Clients avoid wasting time on properties they can't purchase. You protect your most limited resource. And deals don't fall apart late when issues surface that should have been caught early.

Score every prospect systematically. Your gut isn't enough.
