## Question 1

A client says "This all looks good. Let me think about it and get back to you." What's the most effective response?

- [ ] "Of course, take all the time you need. Just let me know when you're ready"
- [ ] "I understand, but these units are selling fast—I'd recommend deciding today"
- [x] "Absolutely. Can I ask what specifically you'd want to think through? I want to make sure you have all the information you need"
- [ ] "No problem. I'll check in with you next week if I haven't heard anything"

**Explanation:** "Let me think about it" often masks a specific concern that hasn't been addressed. The best response acknowledges their need to think while exploring what's actually driving the hesitation. This often reveals an addressable objection. Simply agreeing and waiting loses momentum, while pressure creates resistance.

## Question 2

Which of the following is a GENUINE buying signal indicating readiness to discuss the EOI?

- [ ] "This is interesting information"
- [ ] "What other projects should I be looking at?"
- [x] "How quickly could we secure this specific unit?"
- [ ] "Dubai seems like a good market"

**Explanation:** "How quickly could we secure this specific unit?" indicates the client is thinking about action and this particular property. It's forward-looking and specific. The other responses show interest but are either vague, exploratory (looking at other options), or focused on the market rather than a specific purchase decision.

## Question 3

A client is ready to proceed but asks about the EOI refundability. How should you frame your response?

- [ ] Avoid discussing refundability as it might encourage them to back out
- [ ] Emphasize that most people who submit EOIs proceed with the purchase
- [x] Explain clearly that the EOI is refundable if they decide not to proceed, reducing perceived risk
- [ ] Suggest they should only submit if they're certain they want the property

**Explanation:** Transparency about EOI refundability actually helps conversion—it reduces perceived risk and demonstrates that you're advising in their interest, not just pursuing commission. Avoiding the topic or creating pressure around certainty creates suspicion. The best approach is clear, honest explanation.

## Question 4

You're presenting to a couple where one partner is ready to proceed and the other is hesitant about long-term commitment. What's the best approach?

- [ ] Focus your conversation on the ready partner and hope they convince the hesitant one
- [x] Acknowledge both perspectives and address the hesitant partner's specific concerns directly
- [ ] Suggest they discuss privately and come back when they're aligned
- [ ] Emphasize the investment returns to appeal to the logical side of the decision

**Explanation:** When couples have different levels of readiness, acknowledge both perspectives explicitly. The deal won't close if one partner feels ignored or pressured. Address the hesitant partner's concerns directly—understanding their specific worry often reveals something addressable. Focusing only on the ready partner or leaving them to resolve it privately loses the opportunity to help.

## Question 5

A client has verbally agreed to proceed with the EOI but then says "Actually, can I see the property one more time before I commit?" What's the most effective response?

- [ ] "Of course—when would you like to schedule that?"
- [ ] "We really should lock in the unit first—we can always view later"
- [x] "Of course. What specifically would you want to look at this time? I want to make sure we focus on the right things when we visit"
- [ ] "The unit you're considering may not be available if we wait for another viewing"

**Explanation:** When someone who's agreed to proceed suddenly asks for another viewing, they may have a legitimate need—or they may be delaying because of an unspoken concern. The best response agrees to the viewing while understanding what's driving the request. This often reveals the actual hesitation that needs addressing. Creating urgency or simply agreeing without understanding doesn't address the underlying issue.
