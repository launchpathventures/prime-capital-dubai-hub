The first sixty seconds of contact determine whether you earn a conversation or lose to a faster competitor.

When an investor submits an enquiry on Property Finder, that enquiry goes to three to five agents simultaneously. The buyer is often still browsing when your call comes in. The first professional response anchors their expectations — they mentally assign the opportunity to whoever responds first.

The data is clear: leads contacted under sixty seconds convert three times higher. After five minutes, conversion drops by eighty percent. After thirty minutes, someone else has already won.

This module gives you the exact scripts and systems for winning that critical window. You'll learn the primary portal lead response script, the "if they're busy" recovery script, and the website enquiry approach for higher-intent leads.

But speed alone isn't enough. You need speed combined with professionalism. A fast, generic response still loses to a thoughtful, personalised one — the goal is to be both fast AND good.

You'll also build your response system: notification setup, pre-prepared templates, calendar blocks for peak hours, and backup coverage when you're unavailable.

Master the sixty-second window, and you'll have more conversations than your competitors could ever dream of.
