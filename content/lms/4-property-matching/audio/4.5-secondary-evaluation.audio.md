TYPE: skills

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Welcome to Secondary Market Evaluation — where you'll learn to assess resale properties systematically.

The secondary market means ready properties — completed, often tenanted, with a track record you can evaluate. What you see is what you get. No construction risk, no waiting, no renders versus reality.

In this module, you'll learn to evaluate secondary properties across five dimensions: physical condition, building management, pricing assessment, seller motivation, and rental performance.

You'll understand the trade-offs between secondary and off-plan. Higher entry prices but immediate income. Less payment flexibility but no construction risk. Known performance versus projections.

Most importantly, you'll learn to use actual data. A property with a consistent tenant at one hundred twenty thousand per year is more valuable than a similar property with estimated rent of one hundred thirty thousand that's been vacant.

By the end, you'll assess secondary opportunities with the same rigour you apply to off-plan — matching the right type of property to the right investor profile.

Let's get into the evaluation process.

### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

**CONTEXT**

You'll use this process whenever you evaluate resale properties. For investors who need immediate rental income, want certainty, or are making their first Dubai purchase, secondary is often the right choice. Your job is to assess value and condition accurately — and present opportunities honestly.

**THE PROCESS**

Let me walk you through the five evaluation dimensions.

First, physical condition. Unlike off-plan, you can inspect secondary properties. Do so thoroughly. Check building common areas — lobby, corridors, gym, pool. Their condition tells you about building management. Check unit condition — flooring, paint, fixtures, appliances. Check HVAC — air conditioning units, their age and maintenance. Check windows and seals for condensation, leaks, or damage. Check plumbing — water pressure, drainage, visible issues. And check balcony or terrace condition.

Red flags include deferred maintenance in common areas — it suggests poor building management — owner unwillingness to allow thorough inspection, evidence of water damage or structural issues, and outdated systems that will need replacement.

Second, building management. How well is the building managed? This affects ongoing experience and resale value. Research who manages the building — reputation matters. Get exact service charge figures, not estimates. Ask about outstanding disputes or legal issues. Check the occupancy rate — low occupancy can indicate problems. And find out if there are planned major works that could mean special levies.

Third, pricing assessment. Is the asking price fair? Secondary pricing is negotiable, unlike developer prices. Research recent transactions — what have similar units in the same building sold for? Check current listings — what else is available at what price? Calculate price per square foot and compare to area averages. And check if the rental yield at asking price makes sense.

For example, if similar units sold at fifteen fifty to fifteen eighty per square foot, but this one is asking sixteen thirty, there's negotiation room. That data gives you leverage.

Fourth, seller motivation. Understanding why someone is selling helps you assess value and negotiation potential. Relocation often means motivated by timeline — may accept lower offers. Upgrading or downsizing depends on their purchase timing. Investment exit usually means price-focused. Financial pressure is most motivated — may accept significant discount. Estate sale often means executors want quick resolution.

Ask tactfully: how long has it been listed? Any previous offers? Is there a timeline? What's the background to the sale?

Fifth, rental performance. If the property has been rented, get actual data. Request current lease terms and amount, rental history — has it been continuously let? — tenant payment history, and when the current lease expires.

Actual rental data beats projections every time. When you can say "this property has been continuously rented since twenty-nineteen at one hundred five thousand annually," that's more compelling than "similar properties rent for about one hundred thousand."

**COMMON PITFALLS**

First, skipping due diligence because it's "ready." Physical inspection is essential. Walk through the property carefully.

Second, accepting listed price as market value. Secondary is negotiable. Research comparables and seller motivation before advising on offer strategy.

Third, ignoring building management quality. A well-managed building holds value. A poorly managed one becomes a headache and affects resale.

**PRO TIP**

When presenting secondary properties, use actual data not estimates. Don't say "similar properties rent for about one hundred thousand." Do say "this unit has been rented continuously since twenty-nineteen. The current tenant is paying one hundred five thousand annually on a lease that expires in August." Specificity builds confidence.
