Welcome to Module 1.3: Regulatory Framework. For international investors—especially those aware of Dubai's pre-2008 history—understanding regulatory protections is essential to building confidence. This is how you demonstrate that Dubai has matured.

Here are the essentials:

First, RERA oversight. The Real Estate Regulatory Authority licenses every developer, project, and agent. If something is not RERA-registered, walk away. This is your first verification step on every transaction.

Second, escrow protection. Off-plan payments go into regulated accounts, not developer pockets. Funds release only as construction milestones are verified. This eliminates the pre-2008 risk of developers collecting money without building.

Third, Oqood registration. For off-plan purchases, Oqood creates a legal record of buyer claims before the property is built. It establishes protection before the title deed exists.

Fourth, transaction costs. Budget 6 to 8 percent beyond purchase price. DLD registration is 4%, agency commission is 2%, plus fixed fees. Know these numbers—clients will ask.

Your key takeaway: Regulatory knowledge protects your clients and protects your credibility. When clients see you navigate regulations confidently, they trust your expertise on everything else.
