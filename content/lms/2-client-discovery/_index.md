# Client Discovery

Client discovery is the foundation of exceptional advisory. While inexperienced agents jump straight to showing properties, you will first understand what each client actually needs—which is rarely what they initially ask for.

## Why This Matters

The gap between what clients say and what they need is where value is created. An investor asking for "a two-bedroom apartment in Marina" might actually need:
- A yield-focused investment they can manage remotely
- A property qualifying them for Golden Visa
- An asset to diversify away from their home market
- A future residence for eventual relocation

Without proper discovery, you'll show properties that match surface criteria but miss the deeper requirements. The result: wasted viewings, frustrated clients, and lost opportunities.

## What You'll Learn

This competency builds your ability to:

1. **Recognize Investor Types** — Understand the motivations and concerns of different investor personas (end-users, investors, visa-seekers)

2. **Ask Effective Questions** — Master discovery frameworks tailored to each client type, uncovering real needs beyond surface requests

3. **Listen Actively** — Develop techniques for hearing what clients mean, not just what they say

4. **Qualify Opportunities** — Apply the BANT+ framework to assess client readiness and fit

5. **Manage Expectations** — Set realistic expectations from the first conversation to build trust and prevent disappointments

## The Prime Capital Approach

Our discovery process differs from typical agents in three ways:

**Depth over Speed** — We invest more time in discovery, even if it delays showing properties. This investment pays dividends in client satisfaction and transaction success.

**Questions over Assumptions** — We never assume we know what a client needs. Every recommendation flows from explicit discovery, not pattern matching.

**Honesty over Optimism** — If a client's expectations don't match market reality, we address this early. Managing expectations is a kindness, not a sales obstacle.
