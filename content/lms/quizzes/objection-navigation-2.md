questions:
  - id: "q1"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor says: 'I remember reading about Dubai's 50% crash in 2008. Why should I believe it won't happen again?' What structural difference should you highlight first?"
    options:
      - text: "Current prices are lower than 2008 peaks"
        correct: false
      - text: "Population growth is stronger now"
        correct: false
      - text: "RERA now requires developers to hold funds in escrow, preventing the speculation that caused 2008"
        correct: true
      - text: "The global economy is more stable now"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The 2008 crash was enabled by speculation (projects resold multiple times before completion) and loose developer controls. RERA's escrow requirements, mortgage regulations (50% LTV for non-residents), and transaction fees are structural changes that address the root causes."

  - id: "q2"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When an investor says 'I'll wait for prices to drop,' what's the most effective response approach?"
    options:
      - text: "Tell them prices are about to rise imminently"
        correct: false
      - text: "Explain the opportunity cost of waiting: rental income foregone, potential appreciation missed, visa benefits delayed"
        correct: true
      - text: "Agree that waiting is a good strategy"
        correct: false
      - text: "Challenge them to prove prices will drop"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Rather than creating false urgency or pressure, help investors understand the tangible costs of waiting—foregone rental income at 6-7% yield, missed appreciation, delayed residency benefits. This respects their autonomy while providing full information."

  - id: "q3"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor has been researching Dubai for 18 months and keeps finding reasons to wait. What might this pattern indicate?"
    options:
      - text: "They're exceptionally careful decision makers"
        correct: false
      - text: "Property investment may not actually be right for them"
        correct: true
      - text: "They're waiting for a specific price point"
        correct: false
      - text: "They need more information from you"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If someone is always finding reasons to wait, the reason might not be the market—it might be that property investment doesn't feel right for them, or there's a deeper hesitation. Naming this pattern opens space for honest conversation about what would actually make them ready."

  - id: "q4"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor from Singapore says: 'Dubai looks volatile compared to Singapore property.' What's the appropriate response approach?"
    options:
      - text: "Argue that Dubai is actually more stable than Singapore"
        correct: false
      - text: "Dismiss Singapore as overpriced"
        correct: false
      - text: "Acknowledge Dubai has shown volatility, but highlight diversification benefits and different demand drivers"
        correct: true
      - text: "Focus only on yield comparison"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Don't dismiss legitimate observations. Acknowledge Dubai's historical volatility honestly, then position: Dubai offers diversification from Singapore (less correlated to Western cycles), different demand sources (India, GCC, Africa), and potentially higher yields. The question is fit within their portfolio."

  - id: "q5"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "When addressing 'Is Dubai in a bubble?' concerns, what's the difference between sentiment and structure?"
    options:
      - text: "Sentiment is more important for investment decisions"
        correct: false
      - text: "Structure refers to regulations and market mechanics that protect buyers; sentiment can be misleading"
        correct: true
      - text: "Both are unreliable indicators of market health"
        correct: false
      - text: "Sentiment drives prices; structure is irrelevant"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Sentiment was deeply negative about Dubai post-2020 but proved wrong. Structure—escrow requirements, mortgage regulations, transaction costs—provides more reliable indicators of market stability. Lead with structural analysis, not sentiment reassurance."

  - id: "q6"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the correct Dubai rental yield to cite when comparing to global markets?"
    options:
      - text: "3-4%"
        correct: false
      - text: "10-12%"
        correct: false
      - text: "6-7% (average approximately 6.9%)"
        correct: true
      - text: "15-20%"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Dubai's average rental yield is approximately 6.9%, compared to 3-4% in London and Singapore. This is one of the strongest comparison points for Dubai—tangible income generation while holding the asset. Use accurate figures, not inflated numbers."

  - id: "q7"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "An investor says: 'Everyone is bullish on Dubai. That worries me—when everyone agrees, things usually turn.' How should you handle this?"
    options:
      - text: "Tell them they're wrong to be contrarian"
        correct: false
      - text: "Acknowledge contrarian thinking has value, then pivot to structural analysis"
        correct: true
      - text: "Agree that the market is probably overheated"
        correct: false
      - text: "Dismiss their concern as uninformed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Acknowledging that contrarian thinking has value respects their intelligence. Then pivot to what matters more than sentiment: the structural framework that differs from 2008. This approach validates their thinking while providing the evidence they need."

  - id: "q8"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    question: "What's the key distinction when comparing current prices to Dubai's 2014 peak?"
    options:
      - text: "2014 prices were fraudulently inflated"
        correct: false
      - text: "Nominal prices approaching previous peaks don't account for infrastructure transformation, evolved buyer composition, and changed global comparison"
        correct: true
      - text: "Current prices are actually lower than 2014 in real terms"
        correct: false
      - text: "The 2014 peak was only in specific areas"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Price-to-previous-peak is one metric, but not the only one. Since 2014: infrastructure has transformed (Metro, Expo legacy), buyer composition has shifted to more end-users, and Dubai has become more affordable relative to London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Context matters."
