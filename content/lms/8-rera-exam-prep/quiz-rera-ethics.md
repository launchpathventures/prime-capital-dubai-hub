- [ ] Maximizing transaction volume
- [x] Acting in the client's best interest with loyalty and good faith

- [ ] Proceed with marketing and disclose only if asked
- [ ] Wait until a buyer makes an offer before disclosing
- [x] Immediately disclose the dispute to all potential buyers
- [ ] Advise the seller to resolve it before listing

**Explanation:** Material facts that could affect a buyer's decision must be disclosed immediately. A boundary dispute is a significant legal issue that affects property rights and value.

## Question 3

A client asks a broker to withhold information about their financial constraints from the seller. The broker should:

- [x] Maintain client confidentiality as this is private negotiation strategy
- [ ] Immediately disclose to the seller
- [ ] Refuse to represent the client
- [ ] Document the request and report to RERA

**Explanation:** A client's financial position and negotiation strategy are confidential unless disclosure is legally required. The broker owes confidentiality to their client while remaining truthful to all parties.

---

## Question 4

Which of the following represents a conflict of interest?

- [ ] Representing a buyer looking at multiple properties
- [ ] Working as an agent for the seller exclusively
- [x] Receiving undisclosed compensation from a developer for recommending their properties
- [ ] Referring a client to a recommended mortgage broker with disclosure

**Explanation:** Receiving any compensation or incentive that could influence recommendations without disclosing it to the client creates a conflict of interest and violates ethical standards.

---

## Question 5

A seller instructs their broker to discriminate against buyers based on nationality. The broker should:

- [ ] Follow the client's instructions as fiduciary duty requires obedience
- [ ] Proceed but document the instruction
- [x] Refuse to follow the discriminatory instruction and explain legal/ethical implications
- [ ] Terminate the relationship without explanation

**Explanation:** Brokers must not follow unlawful or unethical instructions. Discrimination based on nationality violates professional ethics and UAE law. The broker should explain this to the client.

---

## Question 6

What constitutes "dual agency" in real estate?

- [ ] Two agents working together on a transaction
- [x] One agent representing both buyer and seller in the same transaction
- [ ] An agent working for two different brokerages
- [ ] Representing multiple buyers on different properties

**Explanation:** Dual agency occurs when the same agent or brokerage represents both parties in a single transaction. It requires full disclosure and informed consent from both parties.

---

## Question 7

An agent receives a gift worth AED 25,000 from a developer after closing a deal. According to RERA ethics, what should the agent do?

- [ ] Accept it as a reward for good service
- [ ] Return it immediately
- [x] Disclose to their employer and client, and follow company policy
- [ ] Donate to charity to avoid any appearance of impropriety

**Explanation:** Gifts and incentives must be disclosed to both the employer and client. The agent should follow their company's policy regarding acceptance of gifts.

---

## Question 8

When must a broker disclose their agency relationship?

- [ ] Only when the client asks
- [ ] At the time of contract signing
- [x] At the earliest practical opportunity before providing substantive services
- [ ] After the transaction is complete

**Explanation:** Agency disclosure must occur at first meaningful contact, before the agent provides substantive services. This allows the other party to make informed decisions about the interaction.

---

## Question 9

A broker suspects their client may be using the transaction to launder money. What is the ethical and legal requirement?

- [ ] Complete the transaction and report afterward
- [ ] Advise the client how to structure the transaction differently
- [x] Refuse to proceed and report suspicions to relevant authorities
- [ ] Continue if the source of funds appears legitimate on documents

**Explanation:** Anti-money laundering regulations require brokers to refuse suspicious transactions and report to the appropriate authorities (FIU). Knowingly participating is a criminal offense.

---

## Question 10

What is the proper handling of a client's personal documents?

- [ ] Keep copies indefinitely for future reference
- [ ] Share with other agents if helpful for the transaction
- [x] Store securely, use only for intended purpose, and return promptly
- [ ] Dispose of immediately after transaction

**Explanation:** Client documents must be handled with care: secured against unauthorized access, used only for their intended purpose, and returned to the client promptly when no longer needed.

---

## Question 11

A broker learns about a potential development that will significantly increase property values in an area. Can they purchase property there before telling clients?

- [ ] Yes, as long as they eventually share the information
- [ ] Yes, if they use a different name for the purchase
- [x] No, this would be using confidential information for personal gain
- [ ] Only if they complete the purchase before the announcement

**Explanation:** Using confidential market information for personal gain before clients can act on it is a breach of fiduciary duty and ethical standards, regardless of timing.

---

## Question 12

What level of skill and knowledge does RERA expect from licensed brokers?

- [ ] Basic understanding of property transactions
- [x] Competency expected of a reasonable professional in the field
- [ ] Expert knowledge in all aspects of real estate and law
- [ ] Only what is taught in the certification course

**Explanation:** Brokers are held to the standard of a reasonably competent professional. They must maintain and update their knowledge through continuing education and market awareness.

---

## Question 13

A broker makes an error in a contract that causes their client financial loss. What is the appropriate response?

- [ ] Deny responsibility to protect their license
- [ ] Blame the other party's representative
- [x] Acknowledge the error, take responsibility, and work to remedy the situation
- [ ] Hide the error if it hasn't been discovered

**Explanation:** Professional ethics require acknowledging mistakes and taking appropriate steps to remedy harm. Concealing errors compounds the ethical violation and may result in more severe consequences.

---

## Question 14

Which behavior violates RERA's Code of Ethics?

- [ ] Declining to represent a client due to scheduling conflicts
- [ ] Recommending clients seek independent legal advice
- [x] Making exaggerated claims about potential rental returns without data support
- [ ] Referring business to colleagues with appropriate disclosure

**Explanation:** Making unfounded or exaggerated claims about returns, yields, or property performance without proper market analysis and data support violates ethical standards.

---

## Question 15

A former client asks the broker to share details about their previous transaction with a third party. The broker should:

- [ ] Share the information since the transaction is complete
- [ ] Share only positive information
- [x] Decline unless the former client provides written authorization
- [ ] Share because confidentiality ends when the transaction closes

**Explanation:** Confidentiality obligations survive the end of the professional relationship. Client information should not be disclosed without explicit written authorization, even after the transaction.
