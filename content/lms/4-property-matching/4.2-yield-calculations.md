# Yield & ROI Calculations

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **calculate, explain, and compare yields** for any property using The Investment Score methodology — enabling you to justify recommendations with hard numbers rather than opinions.

---

## Why Numbers Matter

Sophisticated investors make decisions based on returns. They don't want to hear "this is a good investment." They want to know: "What exactly will this property earn me, and how does that compare to alternatives?"

Getting yield calculations wrong — or being unable to explain them clearly — destroys credibility instantly. Getting them right positions you as a knowledgeable advisor, not just another salesperson.

**The Prime Capital standard:** Every property recommendation must include a written yield calculation. No exceptions.

---

## The Investment Score Methodology

The Investment Score is Prime Capital's framework for evaluating property returns. It calculates three metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Use For |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Gross Yield** | Annual rent / Purchase price | Quick comparison |
| **Net Yield** | (Annual rent - Costs) / Purchase price | True cash flow |
| **Total Return** | Net yield + Capital appreciation | Full investment picture |

We calculate all three for every property we recommend.

---

## Gross Yield

Gross yield is the simplest calculation. It shows annual rent as a percentage of purchase price.

### Formula

```
Gross Yield = (Annual Rent / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Worked Example 1: Marina 1-Bedroom

**Property:** 1BR apartment, Dubai Marina  
**Purchase price:** AED 1,350,000  
**Size:** 750 sqft  
**Monthly rent:** AED 8,500  
**Annual rent:** AED 102,000

```
Gross Yield = (102,000 / 1,350,000) × 100 = 7.6%
```

### Worked Example 2: JVC 2-Bedroom

**Property:** 2BR apartment, Jumeirah Village Circle  
**Purchase price:** AED 1,100,000  
**Size:** 1,150 sqft  
**Monthly rent:** AED 7,500  
**Annual rent:** AED 90,000

```
Gross Yield = (90,000 / 1,100,000) × 100 = 8.2%
```

### What Gross Yield Tells You

Gross yield is useful for quick comparisons between properties. Higher gross yield generally means better income relative to price.

**However:** Gross yield doesn't account for costs. It's a starting point, not the final answer. The JVC property looks better on gross yield (8.2% vs 7.6%), but the full picture requires net yield calculation.

## Net Yield

Net yield subtracts operating costs from rental income before calculating the percentage. This is the number that matters for cash flow planning.

### Formula

```
Net Yield = ((Annual Rent - Annual Costs) / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Common Operating Costs by Area

| Cost | Standard Building | Branded Residence | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Service charges | AED 12-18/sqft/year | AED 22-35/sqft/year | Biggest variable cost |
| Property management | 5% of rent | 5-8% of rent | If using a management company |
| Maintenance reserve | 1% of property value | 1% of property value | For repairs and upkeep |
| Vacancy allowance | 5% of annual rent | 5% of annual rent | ~2.5 weeks vacant/year |
| RERA fees | AED 220/year | AED 220/year | Ejari registration |

### Service Charges by Area (AED per sqft/year)

Know these numbers — service charges significantly impact net yield:

| Area | Standard | Premium | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| JVC/JVT | 10-14 | 15-18 | Lowest in Dubai |
| Dubai Marina | 14-18 | 20-25 | Varies by building age |
| Downtown | 18-22 | 25-35 | Higher due to location |
| Palm Jumeirah | 20-28 | 30-45 | Highest maintenance costs |
| Business Bay | 14-18 | 20-25 | Similar to Marina |

---

## Worked Example 3: Marina 1BR Full Calculation

Let's calculate the complete net yield for our Marina 1BR example:

**Property:** 1BR apartment, Dubai Marina  
**Purchase price:** AED 1,350,000  
**Size:** 750 sqft  
**Annual rent:** AED 102,000

**Operating costs:**
| Cost | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Service charges | 750 sqft × AED 16 | AED 12,000 |
| Property management | AED 102,000 × 5% | AED 5,100 |
| Maintenance reserve | AED 1,350,000 × 1% | AED 13,500 |
| Vacancy allowance | AED 102,000 × 5% | AED 5,100 |
| RERA fees | Fixed | AED 220 |
| **Total annual costs** | | **AED 35,920** |

**Net operating income:** AED 102,000 - AED 35,920 = **AED 66,080**

```
Net Yield = (66,080 / 1,350,000) × 100 = 4.9%
```

**Investment Score summary:**
- Gross yield: 7.6%
- Net yield: 4.9%
- Yield erosion: 2.7 percentage points (36% of gross yield lost to costs)

---

## Worked Example 4: JVC 2BR Full Calculation

**Property:** 2BR apartment, JVC  
**Purchase price:** AED 1,100,000  
**Size:** 1,150 sqft  
**Annual rent:** AED 90,000

**Operating costs:**
| Cost | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Service charges | 1,150 sqft × AED 12 | AED 13,800 |
| Property management | AED 90,000 × 5% | AED 4,500 |
| Maintenance reserve | AED 1,100,000 × 1% | AED 11,000 |
| Vacancy allowance | AED 90,000 × 5% | AED 4,500 |
| RERA fees | Fixed | AED 220 |
| **Total annual costs** | | **AED 34,020** |

**Net operating income:** AED 90,000 - AED 34,020 = **AED 55,980**

```
Net Yield = (55,980 / 1,100,000) × 100 = 5.1%
```

**Investment Score summary:**
- Gross yield: 8.2%
- Net yield: 5.1%
- Yield erosion: 3.1% (38% of gross yield lost to costs)

---

## Marina vs JVC: Head-to-Head Comparison

Now let's compare our two examples directly:

| Metric | Marina 1BR | JVC 2BR | Winner |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Purchase price** | AED 1,350,000 | AED 1,100,000 | JVC (AED 250K cheaper) |
| **Size** | 750 sqft | 1,150 sqft | JVC (53% larger) |
| **Price per sqft** | AED 1,800 | AED 957 | JVC |
| **Annual rent** | AED 102,000 | AED 90,000 | Marina |
| **Gross yield** | 7.6% | 8.2% | JVC |
| **Net yield** | 4.9% | 5.1% | JVC |
| **Annual cash flow** | AED 66,080 | AED 55,980 | Marina |

**The conversation:**

"So which is better?" — it depends on what your client prioritises.

**For yield-focused investors:** JVC wins. Higher net yield (5.1% vs 4.9%), lower entry point, more space for a tenant family.

**For capital preservation investors:** Marina wins. Premium location, stronger resale liquidity, higher absolute cash flow, and historically better capital appreciation.

**For Golden Visa seekers at AED 2M threshold:** Neither qualifies alone, but the Marina property is closer to the threshold for a second property strategy.

---

## Worked Example 5: Service Charge Impact

This example shows why service charges are critical:

**Two properties, same price, same rent:**

| Factor | Property A (Standard) | Property B (Branded) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Purchase price | AED 1,800,000 | AED 1,800,000 |
| Size | 1,100 sqft | 1,100 sqft |
| Annual rent | AED 108,000 | AED 108,000 |
| Service charge rate | AED 14/sqft | AED 28/sqft |
| Annual service charge | AED 15,400 | AED 30,800 |
| Other costs (est.) | AED 22,000 | AED 22,000 |
| Total costs | AED 37,400 | AED 52,800 |
| Net income | AED 70,600 | AED 55,200 |
| **Net yield** | **3.9%** | **3.1%** |

**Key insight:** Service charges alone create a 0.8% yield difference. On AED 1.8M, that's AED 15,400/year in lost income — over 10 years, that's AED 154,000.

**When to recommend branded:** When the client values the prestige, amenities, or potential for higher capital appreciation that branded residences offer.

## Total Return: The Complete Picture

Yield measures income. Total return measures income plus capital appreciation. For Dubai's growth-oriented market, total return is often more important than yield alone.

### Formula

```
Total Return = ((Annual Net Income + Annual Capital Gain) / Purchase Price) × 100
```

### Off-Plan vs Ready: ROI Comparison

**Scenario:** Investor with AED 1.5M comparing:
- **Option A:** Ready property in JVC (immediate income)
- **Option B:** Off-plan in Dubai Creek Harbour (2-year wait)

**Option A: Ready JVC Property**
- Purchase price: AED 1,500,000
- Net rental income: AED 75,000/year
- Expected appreciation: 5%/year (AED 75,000)
- **Year 1 total return:** AED 150,000 (10%)

**Option B: Off-Plan Creek Harbour**
- Launch price: AED 1,500,000 (60/40 payment plan)
- Capital committed Year 1: AED 900,000 (60%)
- No rental income for 2 years
- Expected handover value: AED 1,800,000 (20% premium)
- **2-year gain:** AED 300,000 on AED 900,000 committed = 33%

| Metric | Ready (JVC) | Off-Plan (Creek) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Year 1 income | AED 75,000 | AED 0 |
| Year 2 income | AED 75,000 | AED 0 |
| Capital appreciation | AED 150,000 | AED 300,000 |
| **Total 2-year gain** | **AED 300,000** | **AED 300,000** |
| Cash deployed | AED 1,500,000 | AED 900,000 |
| **ROI on cash** | **20%** | **33%** |

**The insight:** Off-plan can offer better ROI on capital deployed because of payment plan leverage — but carries construction risk and no income during the wait.

### Worked Example 6: 3-Year Total Return

**Property purchased 3 years ago:**
- Purchase price: AED 1,500,000
- Current market value: AED 1,950,000
- Total capital gain: AED 450,000
- Annualised capital gain: AED 150,000/year

**Annual net rental income:** AED 72,000

```
Annual Total Return = ((72,000 + 150,000) / 1,500,000) × 100 = 14.8%
```

**Investment Score breakdown:**
- Net yield contribution: 4.8%
- Capital appreciation contribution: 10.0%
- **Total return: 14.8%**

This is why Dubai attracts investors: tax-free rental income PLUS meaningful capital growth.

## Capital Appreciation Projections

**Important:** Capital appreciation is not guaranteed. Present projections with appropriate caveats.

### Historical Context (2020-2024)

| Area | 5-Year Price Growth | Annualised |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Palm Jumeirah | +85% | +13%/year |
| Dubai Marina | +62% | +10%/year |
| Downtown Dubai | +58% | +9.6%/year |
| JVC | +45% | +7.7%/year |
| Business Bay | +51% | +8.6%/year |

*Source: DXB Interact, Q4 2024*

### How to Present Appreciation (The Right Way)

**Don't say:** "This property will appreciate 10% per year."

**Do say:** "Based on the past 5 years, properties in Marina have appreciated around 10% annually. We use 5-7% as a conservative projection for financial planning, but past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The income portion of your return is more predictable than the appreciation portion."

### Conservative vs Optimistic Projections

Always present a range:

| Scenario | Yield | Appreciation | Total Return |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Conservative | 5% | 3% | 8% |
| Base case | 5% | 6% | 11% |
| Optimistic | 5% | 10% | 15% |

---

## The Risk-Reward Matrix

Use this framework to match investment approach to client risk tolerance:

| Risk Profile | Recommended Approach | Expected Return | Volatility |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Conservative** | Ready property, established area, long-term hold | 7-10% total return | Low |
| **Moderate** | Ready or late-stage off-plan, premium locations | 10-14% total return | Medium |
| **Growth-focused** | Off-plan in emerging areas, developer launches | 12-18% total return | Higher |

### Matching Client to Strategy

**Conservative investor (pension fund, retiree):**
- Ready property
- Marina, Downtown, Palm
- Focus on net yield stability
- Long-term hold (7-10 years)

**Moderate investor (business owner, first purchase):**
- Ready or nearly complete off-plan
- Marina, Business Bay, Dubai Hills
- Balance yield and growth
- Medium-term hold (5-7 years)

**Growth-focused investor (experienced, portfolio builder):**
- Off-plan at launch
- Creek Harbour, MBR City, Dubai South
- Accept lower yield for appreciation
- Willing to hold through cycles

## Presenting Yields to Investors

### Be Clear About What You're Quoting

Always specify whether you're quoting gross or net. Never let an investor assume.

**Don't say:** "This property yields 7%."  
**Do say:** "The gross yield is 7.6%. After service charges, management fees, and vacancy allowance, the net yield is approximately 4.9%. Let me show you the calculation."

### The Investment Score Presentation

When presenting any property, use this structure:

"Let me give you the Investment Score on this property:

**Purchase price:** AED 1,350,000 for a 1-bedroom in Dubai Marina

**Gross yield:** 7.6% — that's AED 102,000 annual rent on the purchase price

**Net yield:** After we factor in service charges of AED 12,000, property management at 5%, and a vacancy buffer, you're looking at 4.9% net — that's AED 66,000 in your pocket

**Total return projection:** If we assume conservative 5% appreciation, your total return is around 10% annually. Marina has averaged 10% appreciation over the past 5 years, but we plan conservatively."

### Show Your Working

Sophisticated investors want to see the calculation, not just the answer. Have your spreadsheet ready or write it out:

**Example presentation (Marina 1BR):**

"Here's exactly how I calculated the net yield:

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Annual rent (AED 8,500 × 12) | AED 102,000 |
| Less: Service charges (750 sqft × AED 16) | (AED 12,000) |
| Less: Management (5%) | (AED 5,100) |
| Less: Maintenance reserve (1%) | (AED 13,500) |
| Less: Vacancy (5%) | (AED 5,100) |
| Less: RERA fees | (AED 220) |
| **Net operating income** | **AED 66,080** |
| **Net yield** | **4.9%** |

This is a realistic number you can count on, not a marketing figure."

## Coach Walkthrough: The Yield Conversation

<speak>
**Coach:** Let's walk through how to present yield calculations to an investor. I'll play both sides so you can hear how this sounds.

The investor—let's call him David—is comparing a Marina 1-bedroom against a JVC 2-bedroom. He wants to know which is the better investment.

**David:** "So the JVC property has a higher gross yield at 8.2% versus 7.6% for Marina. Doesn't that make it the better investment?"

**Consultant:** "That's a great question, and you're right to look at the numbers. Let me show you the complete picture using what we call The Investment Score.

You're correct that JVC has a higher gross yield. But gross yield is like looking at revenue without costs — it's not what you actually take home.

Let me walk you through both properties."

**Coach:** Notice how the consultant acknowledges the investor's analysis before expanding it. Never dismiss their thinking.

**Consultant:** "For the Marina 1-bed at one point three five million, after we subtract service charges, management, vacancy buffer, and maintenance, the net yield is 4.9%. That's sixty-six thousand dirhams annual cash flow.

For the JVC 2-bed at one point one million, the same calculation gives us 5.1% net yield — that's fifty-six thousand dirhams annual cash flow."

**Coach:** The consultant converted percentages to real money. Investors think in cash flow, not percentages.

**David:** "So JVC gives better yield AND costs less?"

**Consultant:** "For pure yield, yes. But here's where it gets interesting.

Over the past 5 years, Marina has appreciated around 10% annually — that's one hundred thirty-five thousand dirhams per year on this property. JVC has appreciated closer to 7% — about seventy-seven thousand per year.

If we project conservatively at 5% for Marina and 4% for JVC, your total returns look like this:

Marina: 4.9% yield plus 5% appreciation equals 9.9% total return
JVC: 5.1% yield plus 4% appreciation equals 9.1% total return

The Marina property has a slightly higher total return despite lower yield, because of stronger appreciation."

**Coach:** Now the consultant is showing sophisticated analysis. The investor feels informed, not sold to.

**David:** "But that's based on assumptions about appreciation..."

**Consultant:** "Exactly right. Appreciation isn't guaranteed — that's why I call it a projection, not a promise. The yield portion is predictable. The appreciation portion is where we look at track record and location quality.

Here's my take: if you need maximum cash flow today and you're holding for the long term, JVC makes sense. If you want a balance of cash flow and capital preservation, Marina's proven location is worth the premium.

Neither is wrong. It depends on whether you're optimising for income or total return."

**Coach:** The consultant gave a recommendation without being pushy, and respected the investor's autonomy to decide.

## Handle Yield Objections

### "That yield seems low compared to other markets."

"You're right that headline yields in Dubai are typically 4-6% net, which is lower than some emerging markets. Two factors to consider: rental income is tax-free in the UAE, and capital appreciation has averaged 8-10% in premium areas over the past five years. 

When you compare 5% net yield tax-free to 6% yield in a market with 30% tax, Dubai actually nets you more. And the total return picture — including appreciation — is often more compelling than yield alone."

### "How confident are you in these rental estimates?"

"I base rental estimates on actual leases in the same building or comparable properties within the past 90 days. I can share the specific comparables with you. I'd rather give you a realistic number than one we can't achieve."

### "Can't I just use gross yield?"

"Gross yield is fine for initial screening — it tells you which properties are in the right ballpark. But before committing capital, you need net yield to understand actual cash flow. A property with 8% gross yield and high service charges might net less than a property with 7% gross yield and low service charges."

---

## The Payment Plan Calculator (Preview)

For off-plan properties, payment structure affects ROI calculation. We cover this in detail in Module 4.4, but here's the key concept:

**Traditional ROI (ready property):**
- You pay AED 1,500,000
- You earn AED 75,000/year
- ROI = 5%

**Staged ROI (off-plan, 60/40 plan):**
- Year 1: Pay AED 300,000 (20%), earn AED 0
- Year 2: Pay AED 600,000 (40%), earn AED 0
- Handover: Pay AED 600,000 (40%), property worth AED 1,800,000
- 2-year capital gain: AED 300,000 on AED 900,000 deployed = 33% ROI

This is why payment plans matter for investment analysis.

## Practice Checkpoint

Calculate the Investment Score for this property:

**Property:** 2BR in Business Bay  
**Purchase price:** AED 2,200,000  
**Size:** 1,250 sqft  
**Monthly rent:** AED 13,000  
**Service charges:** AED 17/sqft

**Your task:**
1. Calculate gross yield
2. Calculate net yield (assume 5% management, 5% vacancy, 1% maintenance)
3. What's the total return if we assume 6% appreciation?

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>

**Gross yield:**
- Annual rent: AED 156,000
- Gross yield: 156,000 / 2,200,000 × 100 = **7.1%**

**Net yield:**
- Service charges: 1,250 × 17 = AED 21,250
- Management: 156,000 × 5% = AED 7,800
- Vacancy: 156,000 × 5% = AED 7,800
- Maintenance: 2,200,000 × 1% = AED 22,000
- RERA: AED 220
- Total costs: AED 59,070
- Net income: AED 96,930
- Net yield: 96,930 / 2,200,000 × 100 = **4.4%**

**Total return:**
- Net yield: 4.4%
- Appreciation: 6.0%
- Total return: **10.4%**

</details>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Quoting gross as if it's net** — Misleads investors and damages trust when they discover true costs
2. **Ignoring service charges** — Especially problematic for branded residences where charges can be 2x standard
3. **Assuming zero vacancy** — Unrealistic; always budget 4-6% for turnover and marketing time
4. **Forgetting purchase costs in total return** — DLD fees (4%), agency fees (2%), mortgage fees if applicable
5. **Comparing apples to oranges** — Always compare gross to gross, net to net
6. **Presenting appreciation as guaranteed** — Always frame as historical or projected, with caveats

---

## Quick Reference: Yield Calculation Card

**Before the meeting:**
- [ ] Property price and size
- [ ] Current rent or comparable rents
- [ ] Service charge rate (AED per sqft)
- [ ] Building age and management company

**The calculations:**
```
Gross Yield = Annual Rent / Purchase Price × 100
Net Yield = (Rent - Costs) / Purchase Price × 100
Total Return = Net Yield + Appreciation %
```

**Standard cost assumptions:**
- Service charges: Actual from building or estimate
- Management: 5% of rent
- Vacancy: 5% of rent
- Maintenance: 1% of property value
- RERA: AED 220/year

**Presentation structure:**
1. State gross yield
2. Walk through costs
3. State net yield in both % and AED
4. Add appreciation for total return
5. Compare to alternatives

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Gross yield = quick comparison** — Annual rent / purchase price, useful for screening
2. **Net yield = true cash flow** — After service charges, management, vacancy, maintenance
3. **Total return = full picture** — Net yield plus capital appreciation projection
4. **Service charges vary dramatically** — AED 10-35 per sqft depending on building type
5. **Always show your calculations** — Transparency builds trust; sophisticated investors expect it
6. **The Investment Score** — Gross yield, net yield, total return for every property recommendation
7. **Match return profile to risk tolerance** — Conservative, moderate, or growth-focused approach
