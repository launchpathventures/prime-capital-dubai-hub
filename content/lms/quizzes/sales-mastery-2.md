# Sales Mastery Quiz 2
## EOI & Booking Conversion

This quiz tests your understanding of Module 3.5: EOI & Booking Conversion. You need 80% (8/10) to pass.

---

### Question 1

What does EOI stand for in the context of off-plan property sales?

- [ ] A) Enquiry of Interest
- [x] B) Expression of Interest
- [ ] C) Evaluation of Investment
- [ ] D) Execution of Intent

**Explanation:** EOI stands for Expression of Interest — a reservation payment to hold a specific unit while the buyer completes due diligence.

---

### Question 2

What is the typical purpose of an EOI payment?

- [ ] A) To pay the full deposit for the property
- [x] B) To reserve a specific unit while the buyer completes due diligence
- [ ] C) To pay the developer's marketing fees
- [ ] D) To secure a discount on the property price

**Explanation:** The EOI reserves the buyer's preferred unit and gives them time to review the SPA and complete due diligence. It's not the final commitment.

---

### Question 3

How should you frame the EOI when a buyer says "I need more time to think about it"?

- [ ] A) Push them to decide immediately
- [ ] B) Tell them to call you back when they're ready
- [x] C) Explain that the EOI gives them that thinking time while protecting their option, and it's refundable
- [ ] D) Offer a bigger discount to get them to commit

**Explanation:** Reframe the EOI as the solution to their concern — it holds the unit while they think, and it's refundable if they decide not to proceed.

---

### Question 4

What is the target timeframe for converting an EOI to a formal booking (SPA signed)?

- [ ] A) Same day as EOI
- [x] B) 48-72 hours
- [ ] C) 7-14 days
- [ ] D) 30 days

**Explanation:** The 48-72 hour window is optimal. Buyer enthusiasm peaks immediately after EOI — delays allow doubts to creep in.

---

### Question 5

When creating urgency for an EOI, which approach is appropriate?

- [ ] A) "You need to decide today or I can't help you"
- [ ] B) "This unit will definitely be gone by tomorrow!"
- [x] C) "This unit is one of three left at this price point. I can't guarantee availability, but I won't exaggerate either."
- [ ] D) "I have five other buyers ready to take this unit"

**Explanation:** Legitimate urgency based on true facts is acceptable. Fabricating urgency or making guarantees you can't keep destroys trust.

---

### Question 6

What is the first action you should take on the same day an EOI is submitted?

- [ ] A) Wait for the buyer to contact you
- [x] B) Confirm receipt with the buyer and attach the SPA for their review
- [ ] C) Send them a generic thank you email
- [ ] D) Start calling them every hour for updates

**Explanation:** Same-day follow-up should confirm the EOI receipt, provide the SPA for review, and schedule the SPA walkthrough call.

---

### Question 7

A buyer says "What if I change my mind?" when you introduce the EOI. What's the best response?

- [ ] A) "That's why you need to be sure before you pay"
- [ ] B) "Don't worry, that won't happen"
- [x] C) "The EOI is designed for that — you have X days to decide, and it's fully refundable if you're not comfortable proceeding"
- [ ] D) "We don't accept cancellations"

**Explanation:** Address the concern directly by explaining the refundable nature of the EOI and the due diligence period it provides.

---

### Question 8

During the SPA review call, what should you NOT do?

- [ ] A) Walk through the payment schedule
- [ ] B) Explain the developer's obligations
- [x] C) Skip over sections that might raise concerns
- [ ] D) Answer questions about exit clauses

**Explanation:** Never skip over sections that might raise concerns. Transparency builds trust — hiding information destroys it when discovered later.

---

### Question 9

What is an example of apologetic language to avoid when asking for an EOI?

- [x] A) "I know it's a lot of money, but would you consider..."
- [ ] B) "Would you like me to secure this unit for you?"
- [ ] C) "Based on what you've shared, this is a strong fit"
- [ ] D) "The EOI protects your option while you decide"

**Explanation:** Apologising undermines your confidence and the value of the investment. Ask with conviction, not apology.

---

### Question 10

After a buyer signs the SPA and pays the booking deposit, what's the appropriate immediate action?

- [ ] A) End contact until the next payment is due
- [ ] B) Pressure them for referrals immediately
- [x] C) Congratulate them, send documentation, and set expectations for the journey ahead
- [ ] D) Move on to your next prospect without follow-up

**Explanation:** Post-close communication should congratulate the decision, provide documentation, introduce support contacts, and set expectations — this is the beginning of the relationship, not the end.
