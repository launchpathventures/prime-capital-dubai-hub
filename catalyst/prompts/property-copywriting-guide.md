# Prime Capital Property Copywriting Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides detailed instructions for writing property descriptions, investment analysis, and marketing copy for Prime Capital Dubai. Follow these guidelines to ensure all content aligns with the Prime Capital voice and serves sophisticated international investors.

---

## Brand Positioning

### Who Prime Capital Is

Prime Capital Dubai is a **boutique real estate advisory** serving sophisticated international investors. Not a high-volume agency. Not a property portal. An advisory firm that earns trust through restraint, expertise, and discretion.

### The Core Message

> **"Dubai real estate has a trust problem. Prime Capital is the antidote."**

The market is saturated with aggressive, high-volume agencies. HNW investors approach Dubai with valid fears: bubbles, delays, hidden fees, liquidity concerns. Our copy must quietly resolve these fears — never confirm them.

### The One-Liner

> "We move complexity out of sight."

---

## Voice Traits

Every piece of property copy should embody these traits:

| Trait | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Confident** | We know what we're doing. No hedging, no apologies. State facts directly. |
| **Restrained** | We don't shout. We don't oversell. Quality speaks for itself. |
| **Grounded** | Real outcomes, not aspirations. Proof over promise. |
| **Direct** | Short sentences. Clear structure. Get to the point. |
| **Warm** | Professional doesn't mean cold. Respectful and approachable. |
| **Assured** | We don't need to convince. The right people recognise quality. |

---

## What We Avoid (Critical)

### Never Use

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Urgency tactics** | "Limited availability", "Act now", "Don't miss out" — signals desperation |
| **Superlatives** | "Best in class", "world-leading", "unparalleled" — empty calories |
| **Hedging** | "We believe", "we strive to", "we aim to" — weak and uncertain |
| **Exclamation marks** | Never. They undermine gravitas. |
| **Aggressive CTAs** | "Book NOW", "Enquire TODAY" — pushy and brand-damaging |
| **Stock language** | "Passionate about", "committed to excellence", "unique opportunity" |
| **Vague superlatives** | "Stunning", "breathtaking", "incredible" without substance |

### Red Flag Phrases to Eliminate

- "An unmissable opportunity"
- "Act fast before it's gone"
- "The investment of a lifetime"
- "You won't find anything like this"
- "Luxury redefined" / "A new standard of living"
- "For the discerning buyer" (clichéd)
- "Nestled in" / "Boasting" / "Offering"

---

## Language Conventions

### Terminology

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Clients / customers | Investors, clients |
| Properties / listings | Portfolio, residences, developments |
| Buy / purchase | Acquire, invest |
| Deal / transaction | Acquisition, investment |
| Best / top / leading | Established, experienced, trusted |
| Passionate about | Focused on, dedicated to |
| Reach out | Contact, get in touch |
| Boasts / offers | Features, includes, provides |
| Nestled in | Located in, situated in |

### Technical Terms

Introduce technical terms naturally:

- **Off-plan** → "Properties purchased before completion — often called 'off-plan'"
- **Golden Visa** → "The UAE's residency-by-investment programme — commonly known as the Golden Visa"
- **RERA** → "The Real Estate Regulatory Agency — Dubai's property market regulator"

### Spelling & Style

- **Numbers**: Spell out one to nine, use numerals for 10+

## Property Description Structure

### Template

```
[Opening Line: One sentence capturing the essence — what makes this property notable]

[Context Paragraph: 2-3 sentences providing location context, developer reputation, or market positioning]

[Property Details: Key specifications in clear, factual language]

[Closing: Optional sentence on suitability or next steps]
```

### Good Example

> **One Za'abeel Residence**
>
> An exceptional three-bedroom residence in One Za'abeel, Dubai's iconic architectural landmark. This unit offers unobstructed views of the Dubai Frame and Downtown skyline, with interiors finished to the highest specification.
>
> One Za'abeel represents a rare opportunity to own within a limited-inventory development — only 264 residences in the entire complex. The building's direct connectivity to DIFC via The Link positions it at the intersection of lifestyle and business.

### Bad Example (Don't Do This)

> **STUNNING OPPORTUNITY — DON'T MISS OUT!**
>
> This incredible property boasts breathtaking views and world-class amenities! Nestled in the heart of Dubai's most prestigious location, this unique residence offers unparalleled luxury that must be seen to be believed! Act fast — limited availability!

---

## Features Writing

### Structure

Features should be:
- Specific, not generic
- Benefit-oriented where possible
- Concise (5-10 words per feature)

### Good Features

- "Floor-to-ceiling windows with Dubai Frame views"
- "Private elevator access to residence"
- "Bespoke Italian kitchen by [Brand]"
- "Smart home automation with Crestron system"
- "Access to residents-only sky lounge"
- "Direct beach access via private path"
- "Temperature-controlled six-car garage"

### Bad Features (Too Generic)

- "Beautiful views"
- "Modern kitchen"
- "Smart technology"
- "Luxury amenities"
- "Premium finishes"

## Investment Analysis Copy

### "Reasons to Invest" Guidelines

These should be substantive claims that a sophisticated investor would find compelling. Each reason should:

1. **Be specific** — Include numbers, names, or verifiable facts
2. **Address investor concerns** — Liquidity, appreciation, rental yield, quality
3. **Differentiate** — Why this property vs alternatives
4. **Be defensible** — Could you say this to a sceptical client?

### Good Reasons

- "Iconic landmark property with strong brand recognition and resale appeal"
- "Za'abeel consistently outperforms Dubai average with 12.5% YoY appreciation"
- "Limited inventory: Only 264 residences in the entire development"
- "Direct DIFC connectivity via The Link — Dubai's business epicentre"
- "Ultra-rare: Only 6 lighthouse villas exist worldwide in Bulgari portfolio"
- "60/40 payment plan: 60% during construction, 40% on handover — favourable leverage"

### Bad Reasons (Too Vague)

- "Great investment opportunity"
- "Strong potential for appreciation"
- "Excellent location"
- "High-quality development"
- "Prestigious address"

### Developer Track Record

Write a 2-3 sentence summary that establishes credibility:

> "Emaar is the developer behind Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, and Dubai Marina. They have delivered over 90,000 residential units globally and maintain a track record of on-time or early completion. Their branded residence partnerships include Address, Vida, and Armani."

> "Ithra Dubai, a subsidiary of Investment Corporation of Dubai, delivered The Link (world's largest cantilever) on schedule. Portfolio includes One Central and ICD Brookfield Place."

---

## Location Highlights

### Format

```json
{ "time": "5 min", "destination": "DIFC" }
```

### Guidelines

- Use driving times unless walking is more relevant
- Be realistic — don't understate travel times
- Prioritise destinations investors care about:
  - Business districts (DIFC, Downtown)
  - Airports (DXB, DWC)
  - Schools (for family-oriented properties)
  - Beaches, marinas, lifestyle hubs

---

## Comparables

### Purpose

Comparables help investors understand market positioning. They answer: "Is this property priced fairly relative to alternatives?"

### Format

```json
{ "project": "Dorchester Collection", "location": "Business Bay", "pricePerSqFt": 5294 }
```

### Guidelines

- Choose 2-4 genuinely comparable properties
- Include a mix: some higher-priced, some similar, some lower
- Use recent transaction data where possible
- Explain any significant price differences in context

---

## Metric Guidelines

### Price Per Square Foot

- Always use AED unless specified
- Round to nearest whole number
- Compare to area average when available

### Rental Yield

- Express as percentage with one decimal (e.g., 5.8%)
- Base on realistic rental estimates
- Note if gross or net yield

### Historical Appreciation

- Use YoY (year-over-year) figures
- Cite source or timeframe when possible
- Be conservative — don't cherry-pick peak periods

### Service Charges

- Express per square foot per year
- Compare to area averages where relevant

---

## Tone Calibration by Property Type

### Ultra-Luxury / Trophy Assets (AED 50M+)

- **Tone**: Understated, exclusive, prestigious
- **Focus**: Rarity, provenance, store-of-value
- **Avoid**: Any hint of selling — let the property speak

> "One of only six lighthouse villas in the ultra-exclusive Bulgari Resort community. This architectural masterpiece offers the pinnacle of waterfront living."

### Premium Branded Residences (AED 10-50M)

- **Tone**: Confident, sophisticated, investment-minded
- **Focus**: Brand value, location, appreciation potential
- **Avoid**: Overselling amenities — focus on substance

> "A full-floor penthouse in the upcoming Dorchester Collection residences, offering hotel-caliber services with the privacy of a private residence."

### Quality Off-Plan (AED 2-10M)

- **Tone**: Informative, balanced, opportunity-focused
- **Focus**: Developer track record, payment plans, market timing
- **Avoid**: Hype — sophisticated investors see through it

> "Creek Harbour represents Emaar's flagship waterfront development. Current pricing offers entry below comparable completed inventory in Downtown."

## The Eight Investor Fears

Every property should quietly address these concerns:

1. **Bubbles** — Is this market sustainable?
2. **Delays** — Will my property actually be delivered?
3. **Hidden fees** — What costs am I not seeing?
4. **Liquidity** — Can I exit when I need to?
5. **Stability** — Is this a safe place for my capital?
6. **Legitimacy** — Is this firm/developer trustworthy?
7. **Remote management** — Can I manage this from abroad?
8. **The hustle** — Am I being sold to, or advised?

Your copy should resolve these fears through substance, not promises.

## Summary: The Prime Capital Difference

We are not trying to sell every property to every investor. We are presenting carefully selected opportunities to sophisticated clients who will recognise quality.

**Our restraint is our competitive advantage.**

Write copy that earns trust, not attention. Let the properties speak for themselves. Give investors the information they need to make confident decisions.

> "Quality speaks. We don't need to shout."
