MODULE 3.6: Follow-Up Sequences
TYPE: skills
===

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

The fortune is in the follow-up. Most deals don't close on the first conversation — they close because you stayed present without becoming a nuisance.

Here's the reality: forty-eight percent of salespeople never follow up at all. Twenty-five percent make a second contact and stop. Only twelve percent make more than three contacts. Yet eighty percent of sales require five or more follow-ups.

What this means: most of your competition gives up early. Persistence done right is a competitive advantage. The challenge is following up without being annoying.

The key mindset shift is critical. Wrong mindset: "I need to chase them until they buy." Right mindset: "I need to stay valuable until they're ready." Chasing creates pressure. Staying valuable creates relationship.

This module gives you the complete follow-up sequence from Day Zero to Day Fourteen and beyond. You'll learn the exact timing, the right channels, and the message frameworks that add value instead of just asking for something.

You'll also learn when to persist and when to release — because there's a point where follow-up becomes harassment, and recognising that point protects both your reputation and your pipeline health.

### WALKTHROUGH (2-4 minutes)

**CONTEXT**

You'll use follow-up sequences for every lead that doesn't convert on first contact — which is most of them. A systematic approach ensures no opportunity falls through the cracks while protecting your professional reputation.

**THE PROCESS**

Here's the complete sequence from Day Zero through Day Fourteen.

Day Zero is immediate response. Within sixty seconds, send a WhatsApp using the first contact script. If no response within three to four hours, follow up with: "Just following up on my earlier message. I have some information about the development that might be useful. Let me know if you'd like me to send it through."

Day One is your value follow-up. Don't ask for anything — provide something. Send a quick comparison of payment plans, or share specific intel: "The developer released additional units on the floor you were interested in — two new options if you'd like to see them."

Day Three is your check-in call. This is where you try to have a real conversation. "Did you get a chance to review the information I sent? Any questions I can help with?" If they're still interested but not ready, ask permission to check in again in a few days.

Day Five is an email with market context. Subject line: "Quick update on Creek Harbour area." Share one or two sentences of relevant market news. "This might affect timing if you're still considering the development. Happy to discuss what this means for your situation."

Day Seven is a light touch. Keep it brief: "Hope you're having a good week. Just wanted to check if anything has changed on your end, or if there's anything I can help with. No pressure — just here if you need me."

Day Fourteen is re-engagement — your final active outreach before reducing intensity. "I realise you've been busy. I wanted to reach out one more time. If now isn't the right time, I completely understand. I'll keep you on my list for relevant opportunities. But if you're still interested and just haven't had a chance to circle back, I'd love to help. What's the best way to move forward?"

After Day Fourteen, if there's no response, shift to monthly nurture: market updates, new launch notifications, seasonal check-ins. They're not gone — they're just not ready yet.

**COMMON PITFALLS**

Three mistakes to avoid.

First, the desperate check-in: "Just checking in again. Haven't heard from you. Are you still interested?" This adds no value and sounds desperate.

Second, the guilt trip: "I've sent you several messages without a response." This makes them feel bad and damages the relationship.

Third, the pressure push: "This unit will definitely be gone by tomorrow!" If it's not true, you've lost credibility. If it is true, frame it as information, not manipulation.

**PRO TIP**

Every follow-up message should use the value-add framework: acknowledge briefly, provide value, invite next step. "Hope you had a good weekend. I noticed the developer just announced early handover bonuses for buyers who complete before December — could be relevant given the timeline we discussed. Worth a quick chat?"

You're giving them a reason to respond, not guilt-tripping them into it.
