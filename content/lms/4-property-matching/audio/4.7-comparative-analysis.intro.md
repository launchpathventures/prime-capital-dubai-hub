Welcome to Comparative Market Analysis — where you'll learn to structure property comparisons that help investors decide confidently.

Investors rarely buy the first property they see. They want to understand options, weigh trade-offs, and feel confident they've considered alternatives. Comparative market analysis — CMA — structures this comparison.

In this module, you'll learn a five-step framework. Define comparison criteria based on investor requirements. Gather data consistently for each property. Build a comparison matrix that puts options side by side. Highlight trade-offs with clear analysis. And facilitate the decision without dictating it.

You'll also learn when to recommend against all options. Sometimes the honest answer is "none of these is right." Recommending against a transaction protects your credibility far more than forcing a poor fit.

By the end, you'll move the conversation from "Is this a good property?" to "Which property best fits my requirements?" — and sometimes to "We should wait for better options."

Let's get into the framework.
