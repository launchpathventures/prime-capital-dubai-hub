For visa-seekers, the property is secondary. UAE residency is the goal—ten-year Golden Visa, access to banking, business flexibility, travel convenience. The AED two million threshold is their filter, not their investment thesis.

Here's the challenge: most visa-seekers don't realize that meeting minimum requirements and making a sound property decision are different things. Your job is to deliver both.

Start with residency objectives. Why UAE residency? Personal relocation, business convenience, escape from instability? The answer shapes everything.

Timeline matters more than usual. Visa-seekers often have external deadlines—expiring visas elsewhere, business requirements, upcoming travel. Speed sometimes trumps optimization.

Educate on requirements. Many clients have incomplete understanding of Golden Visa rules. AED two million minimum, property type requirements, family eligibility—fill the gaps.

Surface secondary objectives. Once the visa box is checked, what else matters? Yield potential? Personal use? Location preference? Most have preferences beyond the threshold.

Budget exploration is critical. Are they investing exactly AED two million, or is there flexibility? Single property or multiple? Cash or financing?

The best outcome is a property that qualifies for Golden Visa AND makes sense as an investment. Don't let the visa focus distract from property fundamentals.
