## Task: Generate Project State of Play (Current)
_Use this to create a State of Play document for handover to new Project chats, Coding Agents, or collaborators._

@AI: Based strictly on what is known and agreed so far, produce a **Project State of Play (Current)** document.

This is a **Catalyst project**. The State of Play captures where we are in the delivery journey — which stage (POC/MVP/MMP/PROD), what's been validated, and what's next.

This document is a **factual snapshot of the project as it exists right now**.
It is not a vision document, roadmap, or proposal.

---

## Usage & Boundaries (Read First)

- This document captures **current reality**, not future intent.
- Do **not** infer or invent scope, solutions, or next phases beyond what is explicitly stated.
- Decisions marked as **locked** must not be revisited unless explicitly instructed by a human.
- This document complements (but does not replace):
  - the **Vision** (why and success),
  - the **Architecture** (rationale and trade-offs).

---

## 1. Current Phase

- Current phase (e.g. discovery, alignment, POC build, refinement)
- What this phase is explicitly trying to achieve
- What “done” for this phase looks like (at a high level)

---

## 2. What Has Been Completed

### Completed Work
- Work that has been completed and reviewed
- Outputs or artefacts that exist today

### Locked Decisions (Do Not Reopen Without Explicit Direction)
- Decisions that are considered final for the current phase
- Constraints or boundaries that must be respected
- Explicit “no-go” areas or exclusions

---

## 3. What Is In Progress

- Active work streams
- Open threads that are underway
- Work that has started but is not yet validated

---

## 4. What Has Been Learned

- Key insights from workshops, reviews, or delivery
- Assumptions that have been validated or invalidated
- Notable feedback that has materially shaped direction

---

## 5. Open Questions & Known Risks

### Open Questions
- Questions that must be answered to progress
- Areas where intent, scope, or priority is still unclear

### Known Risks
- Delivery, scope, technical, or stakeholder risks
- Dependencies or uncertainty that could impact progress

---

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

- The next concrete actions to move the project forward
- Inputs or decisions required from humans
- What should happen next **without extending scope**

---

## Notes for Handover

- This State of Play is valid **as of now**.
- If context changes, a new State of Play should be generated.
- Treat this document as the single source of truth for “where we are today”.

Produce the **Project State of Play (Current)** now.
