# Stall & Delay Objections

## Introduction

"I need to think about it." "Send me the information and I'll review it." "Let me discuss with my partner." "I'll get back to you next month."

Stall objections are different from the others we've covered. Market objections, developer concerns, and price questions have substance—there's something concrete to address. Stall objections often lack substance. They're ways of ending a conversation without saying "no."

Your challenge is to distinguish between investors who genuinely need time and investors who are declining politely. Push the first group, and you damage the relationship. Accept the second group's excuses indefinitely, and you waste time on deals that will never close.

## The Core Fear

Behind stall objections often lies a fear of commitment: "Making a decision feels risky, so I'll defer it."

But there are other drivers:
- **Genuine need for time**: Complex decisions require processing
- **Unresolved concerns**: There's an objection they haven't voiced
- **External factors**: They're waiting on something outside your control
- **Polite rejection**: They've decided no but don't want to say it

Your job is to identify which category you're dealing with.

## Common Stall Phrases

### "I need to think about it."

**What this might mean:**
- I have unresolved concerns I haven't voiced
- I'm not ready to commit and don't know why
- I've decided no but don't want a confrontation
- I genuinely need processing time

**Exploration response:**

"Of course. Significant decisions deserve consideration.

Can I ask—is there something specific you're uncertain about? Sometimes talking through the sticking point helps clarify whether it's a solvable concern or a fundamental mismatch."

*If they identify a specific concern:* Address it using LAER.

*If they remain vague:*

"I want to respect your process. Let me suggest this: I'll send you a summary of what we've discussed, including the key points about [property/investment]. Take the time you need.

Is there a timeframe when you'll have more clarity? I don't want to chase unnecessarily, but I also don't want to lose touch if you have questions."

### "Send me the information and I'll review it."

**What this might mean:**
- I prefer to evaluate in writing, not conversation
- I want to share this with others who weren't in the conversation
- I'm not interested but want to end the call politely
- I'm an information collector, not a decision maker

**Exploration response:**

"Happy to do that. What specifically would be most useful?

I can send everything we've discussed, but sometimes that's overwhelming. Would it help if I highlighted the three or four things most relevant to your situation?"

*Then:*

"Before I send that—is there anything I haven't addressed that would make or break this decision? I'd rather answer it now than have it sit as a question in your review."

*After sending:*

Set a specific follow-up time. "I'll plan to follow up [day] to see if the materials answered your questions. Does that work?"

---

### "Let me discuss with my partner / advisor / family."

**What this might mean:**
- My partner is genuinely part of this decision
- I need cover for my hesitation
- There are stakeholders I forgot to mention
- I'm deferring to avoid deciding

**Exploration response:**

"Absolutely—decisions like this should include everyone affected.

Can you tell me about your partner's [advisor's] involvement? Are they starting from scratch, or have they been following along?"

*If starting from scratch:*

"Would it help if I joined a call with both of you? I can answer questions directly rather than having you relay information. Sometimes decisions go faster when everyone hears the same thing."

*If they've been following along:*

"What specific questions do you think they'll have? If I can address those in a summary document, it might make your conversation more productive."

---

### "I'll get back to you in a few weeks / after [event]."

**What this might mean:**
- Something external is genuinely happening
- They're waiting for market conditions to change
- They've decided no but want distance before saying it
- They're hoping you'll go away

**Exploration response:**

"Happy to reconnect then. Can I understand what's happening during that time?

Is there something specific—a financial event, a work obligation, a conversation you're having—that will affect your decision? If I know, I can be more useful when we reconnect."

*If there's a real reason:*

"That makes sense. Let me reach out [specific date]. If anything changes before then, you have my details."

*If the reason is vague:*

"I want to be respectful of your time. Can I be direct? Is this decision likely to happen, or should I focus my energy elsewhere? I'd rather hear 'no' now than chase a maybe indefinitely."

---

### "The timing isn't right."

**What this might mean:**
- Financial circumstances have changed
- Life priorities have shifted
- Market conditions concern them
- This is their way of saying no

**Exploration response:**

"What would the right timing look like?

Is this about your personal circumstances—work, family, finances? Or about the market—wanting to see where prices go?"

*If personal:*

"That's completely understandable. Let me know if there's anything I can help with in the meantime—I'm happy to send market updates or new opportunities without pressure."

*If market-related:* Treat as a market objection (Module 6.2).

*If vague:*

"I want to be direct. When someone says timing isn't right but can't specify what would make it right, it often means the investment isn't right for them. That's fine—I'd rather understand that than keep following up on something that won't work."

## Recognising Soft Rejections

Some stall objections are soft rejections. The investor has decided no but is being polite. Recognising these saves everyone time.

**Signs of a soft rejection:**
- Repeated stalls without specific reasons
- Decreasing engagement (shorter responses, longer delays)
- Unwillingness to schedule specific follow-ups
- New objections appearing each time you address one
- Energy and enthusiasm have disappeared from conversations

**How to respond:**

"Can I ask something directly? I sense you may have decided this isn't for you. If that's the case, I'd rather hear it. No hard feelings—this isn't right for everyone. But I don't want to keep following up if you've already moved on."

This gives them permission to say no. Most people find it easier than continuing to dodge.

## Coach Walkthrough

### Scenario: The Eternal "Thinker"

**Setup:** An investor has said "I need to think about it" after every conversation for two months.

**Investor says (again):** "Let me think about it some more. I'll let you know."

**Strong response:**

*Don't repeat what hasn't worked.*

"I appreciate that. Can I share an observation?

We've had several conversations over the past two months, and each time you've needed more thinking time. That's completely fine—but I'm wondering if there's something I'm not addressing.

Is there a specific concern that keeps coming up when you think about this? Or—and I ask this without any pressure—has your thinking led you toward 'no' but you haven't wanted to say it?

Either answer is fine. I'd just rather understand where we are than keep having the same conversation."

**Why this works:**
- Names the pattern without accusation
- Opens space for hidden concerns
- Gives permission to say no
- Shows respect for their time and yours

### Scenario: The Partner Shield

**Setup:** An investor has referenced their partner in every conversation but the partner never joins calls.

**Investor says:** "I've discussed it with my wife. She has some questions. I'll get back to you."

**Strong response:**

"I'd love to answer her questions directly. What are they?"

*If vague:* "It would be more efficient if I joined a call with both of you. That way she can ask questions and I can answer without anything getting lost in translation. Would she be available for a brief call this week?"

*If they resist the three-way call consistently:*

"I want to help, but I notice we've been in a loop—I answer questions, you take them to your wife, more questions come back. 

Would it be fair to say that if your wife isn't comfortable, this won't happen? If so, I really should be talking to her directly. Or is there something else driving the hesitation?"

**Why this works:**
- Attempts to bring the actual decision maker in
- Identifies if the partner is a shield or real stakeholder
- Addresses the pattern directly

## Maintaining Relationship Quality

Some decisions take time. Your job is to remain useful and professional through extended cycles without becoming a nuisance.

**Principles:**
- Follow up with value, not just "checking in"
- Respect stated timelines (if they said two weeks, wait two weeks)
- Share relevant news or opportunities when appropriate
- Be willing to say "let's put this on hold" if momentum is clearly lost

**What to send between conversations:**
- Market updates relevant to their interests
- New projects that match their criteria
- Price changes on properties they've viewed
- News about developers or areas they've discussed

**What not to do:**
- Daily or weekly "just checking in" messages
- Creating false urgency ("this won't last")
- Guilt messaging ("haven't heard from you")
- Continuing to chase after clear soft rejection

## Key Takeaways

- Stall objections require diagnosis—genuine delay, hidden concern, or soft rejection
- Exploration questions help identify what's really happening
- Give investors permission to say no—it's better than indefinite maybes
- Recognise patterns: repeated stalls without specifics often mean no
- Maintain relationship quality with value-based follow-up, not pressure
- Know when to step back gracefully—some deals aren't meant to close
