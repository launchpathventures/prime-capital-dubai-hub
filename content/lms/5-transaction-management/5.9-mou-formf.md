# MOU & Form F

## Introduction

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), formalized as RERA Form F, is the legally binding agreement that governs secondary market (resale) property transactions. Getting this document right—accurate, complete, and properly executed—is essential for smooth transactions.

This module covers Form F preparation, key clauses, and common issues.

---

## Understanding Form F

### What is Form F?

**Form F** is the standardized MOU template mandated by RERA for secondary market property sales. It's called "Form F" as part of RERA's numbered form system:

- **Form A** — Seller agency agreement (between seller and their agent)
- **Form B** — Buyer contract (between buyer and their agent)
- **Form F** — Memorandum of Understanding (between buyer and seller)
- **Form I** — Agent-to-Agent agreement (commission split between co-broking agents)

### Purpose

Form F establishes:
- Agreement between buyer and seller on sale terms
- Purchase price and payment structure
- Timeline for completion
- Conditions that must be met
- Consequences of default by either party
- Commission obligations

### Legal Status

**Form F is legally binding.** Once signed by both parties:
- Buyer is committed to purchase
- Seller is committed to sell
- Deposit is at risk if buyer defaults
- Seller faces liability if seller defaults
- Terms cannot be changed without mutual agreement

---

## Form F Structure

### Standard Sections

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Header** | Form identification, date |
| **Parties** | Buyer, seller, and agent details |
| **Property** | Unit details, title deed reference |
| **Price** | Purchase price, payment breakdown |
| **Deposit** | Amount, holder, terms |
| **Completion** | Target date, conditions |
| **Conditions** | Subject to clauses |
| **Commission** | Amount, who pays |
| **Default** | Consequences for each party |
| **Signatures** | All parties and witnesses |

---

## Form I: Agent-to-Agent Agreement

### What is Form I?

**Form I** is the standardized RERA form that establishes the commission split agreement between co-broking agents—the buyer's agent and the seller's agent—when they work together on a transaction.

### When Form I is Used

Form I is required when:
- Buyer's agent and seller's agent are from different brokerages
- Commission is being shared between multiple agents
- Clear documentation of commission split is needed before closing

### Key Elements of Form I

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Property Details** | Unit information, location, sale price |
| **Seller's Agent** | Agent name, RERA number, brokerage |
| **Buyer's Agent** | Agent name, RERA number, brokerage |
| **Commission Split** | Percentage or fixed amount for each agent |
| **Payment Terms** | When commission is payable, by whom |
| **Signatures** | Both agents and witness |

### Commission Split Standards

**Typical Arrangements:**
- 50/50 split (most common)
- Negotiated percentage based on lead source
- Fixed amount agreements

**Important:** Commission terms should be agreed before showing properties to avoid disputes at closing.

### Sample Form I

### Best Practices for Form I

1. **Execute early** — Complete Form I when co-broking begins, not at closing
2. **Be specific** — Include exact percentages and payment conditions
3. **Reference Form F** — Link to the associated MOU for the transaction
4. **Keep copies** — Both agents and their brokerages should retain signed copies

### Key Fields in Detail

**Parties Section:**
- Full legal names (as per passports)
- Passport numbers
- Emirates ID numbers (if resident)
- Contact details (phone, email)
- Agent details (name, RERA number, agency)

**Property Section:**
- Building/project name
- Unit number
- Title deed number
- Plot number
- Community/area
- Size (sq ft)
- Parking allocation
- Other inclusions (storage, etc.)

**Price Section:**
- Total purchase price (AED)
- Deposit amount
- Balance payment
- Payment method specified

## Completing Form F

### Pre-Preparation Checklist

Before drafting Form F, verify:

**Property Information:**
- [ ] Title deed obtained and verified
- [ ] Unit number confirmed
- [ ] Parking spaces identified
- [ ] Any inclusions clarified (furniture, fixtures)
- [ ] Outstanding charges checked (service fees, utilities)

**Buyer Information:**
- [ ] Full name as per passport
- [ ] Passport number and expiry
- [ ] Emirates ID (if resident)
- [ ] Contact details
- [ ] Financing status (cash or mortgage)

**Seller Information:**
- [ ] Full name as per title deed
- [ ] Passport number
- [ ] Emirates ID
- [ ] Contact details
- [ ] Mortgage status on property
- [ ] Power of Attorney (if applicable)

### Critical Accuracy Points

**Names Must Match Exactly:**
- Buyer name = exactly as passport
- Seller name = exactly as title deed
- Any discrepancy causes transfer issues

**Property Details Must Match Title:**
- Unit number as per title deed
- Building name as registered
- Any parking must be on title (or separate deed)

**Numbers Must Be Consistent:**
- Purchase price in numbers AND words
- Deposit amount clear
- Balance calculation correct

---

## Deposit Terms

### Standard Practice

**Amount:** 10% of purchase price  
**Holder:** Conveyancing office (trustee)  
**Payment:** Manager's cheque to conveyancing office  
**Timing:** At MOU signing or within specified period

### Deposit Scenarios

**Buyer Completes:**
- Deposit released to seller at transfer
- Forms part of purchase price

**Buyer Defaults:**
- Deposit forfeited to seller
- Seller may claim additional damages in some cases

**Seller Defaults:**
- Deposit returned to buyer
- Seller may owe additional compensation (typically equal to deposit)

### Deposit Holder

Deposits are typically held by a conveyancing company, which acts as a neutral third party. When not using a conveyancing company, the **seller's agent** holds the deposit.

**Best Practice:** Use a conveyancing office whenever possible:
- Conveyancing office (preferred)
- Licensed trustee
- Escrow account
- Seller's agent (when no conveyancing company is used)

**Why Use a Third Party:**
- Legal protection for all parties
- Neutral third party
- Clear procedures for release

---

## Conditions Precedent

### Common Conditions

**"Subject to" Clauses:**

**1. Subject to Mortgage Approval**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Buyer obtaining mortgage financing of [amount] from a UAE bank within [X] days. If mortgage is declined, Buyer may terminate and receive full deposit refund."

**When to Include:** Buyer requires financing

**2. Subject to NOC**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Seller obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the developer/community within [X] days."

**When to Include:** Standard—always required

**3. Subject to Clear Title**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Seller providing clear title, free of any encumbrances, mortgages, or liens."

**When to Include:** Standard best practice

**4. Subject to Inspection**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Buyer conducting a satisfactory property inspection within [X] days."

**When to Include:** Buyer wants formal inspection period

### Drafting Conditions Properly

**Good Condition:**
> "Subject to Buyer obtaining mortgage pre-approval of minimum AED 1,500,000 within 14 days of this agreement. Buyer to provide written confirmation of approval or decline."

**Poor Condition:**
> "Subject to financing."

**Difference:** Good condition specifies amount, timeline, and evidence required.

## Completion Timeline

### Setting the Date

**Typical Timeline:** 30-60 days from MOU signing

**Factors to Consider:**
- Mortgage approval time (if financing)
- NOC processing time (varies by developer)
- Seller's mortgage discharge (if applicable)
- Buyer's funds availability
- All parties' schedules

### Extension Provisions

Include language for:
- Mutual agreement to extend
- Automatic extension if NOC delayed
- Specific dates vs. "reasonable time"

**Example:**
> "Completion shall occur within 45 days of this agreement or within 7 days of NOC issuance, whichever is later. Either party may request extension of up to 14 days with written consent of the other party."

### Standard Commission

| Party | Rate | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Buyer | 2% + VAT | Paid by buyer to buyer's agent |
| Seller | 2% + VAT | Paid by seller to seller's agent |

### Form F Commission Section

## Common Form F Issues

### Issue 1: Name Discrepancy

**Problem:** Name on MOU doesn't match passport or title deed

**Prevention:** Triple-check names against original documents

**Prevention:** Draft conditions with clear criteria, timelines, evidence requirements

**Resolution:** Supplementary agreement clarifying condition terms

### Issue 3: Deposit Dispute

**Problem:** Parties disagree on deposit release after default

**Prevention:** Clear default terms; deposit with neutral trustee

**Resolution:** Trustee follows Form F terms; disputes to RERA/courts

### Issue 4: Timeline Extension Conflict

**Problem:** One party wants extension, other refuses

**Prevention:** Build reasonable timelines; include extension provisions

**Resolution:** Follow Form F terms; mediate if possible

### Issue 5: Missing Items at Transfer
