Operating as a real estate broker in Dubai requires RERA registration. This isn't bureaucracy. It's your professional credibility and your license to operate.

Here's the reality. RERA regulations exist because of the 2008 property crash. Developers abandoned projects. Buyers lost deposits. Agents operated with minimal oversight. Today, operating without proper licensing or violating RERA regulations can result in fines up to one million dirhams, license suspension, and criminal penalties. Brokers are fined regularly.

Three compliance essentials you must know. First, all property advertisements require a Trakheesi permit number. This is the number one compliance issue for brokers. No permit, no advertising. Second, off-plan properties require escrow accounts. All buyer payments go to DLD-controlled escrow, not directly to developers. Always verify before any transaction. Third, document everything. Keep records for five years. This protects you if there's ever a dispute.

Your RERA broker card is your professional license. Carry it to viewings, display it when requested, include your BRN in all advertisements. When in doubt about any regulation, verify before acting. One compliance violation can end your career.
