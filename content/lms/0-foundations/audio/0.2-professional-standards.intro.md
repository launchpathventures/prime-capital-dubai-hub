Professional standards at Prime Capital aren't suggestions. They're requirements. And they exist for a specific reason: Dubai's real estate market has a reputation problem.

Years of aggressive tactics and misleading promises have made sophisticated investors deeply skeptical. When a London banker says Dubai agents are pushy, they're speaking from experience. Our professional standards aren't just ethics. They're competitive advantage.

Here's what matters. Four principles guide everything you do. Client interest first, always. If a deal isn't right for the client, recommend against it. Honesty and transparency without exception. Admit when you don't know something. Confidentiality at all times. Never share client information, not even casually. And professionalism in every interaction, whether email, WhatsApp, or in person.

The key takeaway is this: when in doubt, choose the more conservative approach. Your professional reputation takes years to build and seconds to destroy. These standards protect you, protect the client, and protect the firm.

If you observe a violation, report it. Protecting firm integrity is everyone's responsibility.
