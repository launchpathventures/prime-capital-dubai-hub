### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Secondary transactions move fast—thirty to sixty days from MOU to keys. There's no construction period to hide mistakes. Every delay costs you credibility, and coordination failures can collapse deals that should have closed.

Here's what separates successful agents from those who lose deals.

First, understand the timeline pressure. You're coordinating buyer, seller, two agents, developer NOC, possibly banks on both sides, and DLD trustees. One party drops the ball, everyone suffers. Own the coordination even when it's not technically your responsibility.

Second, due diligence happens before MOU, not after. Title verification, mortgage status, service charge clearance—discover problems before your client commits ten percent they might forfeit.

Third, NOC is almost always the critical path. Start the application immediately after MOU signing. Developers don't rush for you. Follow up every few days. Outstanding charges you didn't know about can block NOC for weeks.

Fourth, transfer day requires military precision. Wrong name on a cheque, missing document, seller's bank representative not available—any of these reschedules everything and damages relationships.

The key takeaway: Secondary deals are won or lost on coordination. The agent who tracks every moving part, follows up relentlessly, and prepares for transfer day thoroughly is the agent who closes consistently. The one who assumes everything will work out loses deals to preventable failures.
