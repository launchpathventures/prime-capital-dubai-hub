## Handover Prompt — Project Vision Document
_This prompt helps AI write a project vision document._

@AI: You are now producing the **Project Vision Document** for this project.
This document is the long-lived anchor for the work that follows.
It should clearly articulate **why this project exists, what success looks like, and what matters most**, while also making the intended scope of the current phase explicit.

**Stability note:** This prompt is intentionally stable. Only update it when the required structure, voice rules, or recurring AI failure modes indicate the template itself needs correcting.

This is not a requirements document.
This is not an implementation plan.
This is a **decision-guiding artefact**.

## Purpose of the Vision Document

The Vision Document should:
- Align all stakeholders on the project’s true intent
- Provide a shared definition of success
- Guide trade-offs and decision-making during delivery
- Prevent feature-led or solution-led drift
- Clarify how a focused POC or MVP fits within a broader ambition

A reader should be able to understand:
> “Why are we doing this, who is it for, what are we trying to prove, and what are we *not* trying to do yet?”

## Required Structure

### 1. Project Purpose & Context
- What this project is fundamentally about
- The problem or opportunity it exists to address
- The broader context (organisational, cultural, market, or operational) in which it sits

Focus on *intent*, not solutions.

---

### 2. North Star & Desired Outcomes
- The core direction this project is aiming toward
- The change this project is intended to create
- What meaningful success looks like if this project goes well

This should describe outcomes, not outputs.

---

### 3. Primary Personas & Core Needs
- Who this project is primarily for
- Key personas or audiences involved
- The core needs, jobs-to-be-done, or tensions for each

Avoid edge cases. Focus on the users that matter most for this phase.

---

### 4. Decision Principles
List the principles that should guide decisions when trade-offs arise.

Examples:
- What should be prioritised over speed, polish, or completeness
- What values, constraints, or risks must be respected
- What matters most when things compete (e.g. clarity vs flexibility)

These principles should be usable during delivery.

---

### 5. Prototype / Phase Success Scenarios
Define **1–3 concrete success scenarios** for the current phase (POC or MVP).

For each scenario, include:
- Persona
- Trigger or starting point
- High-level steps
- What success looks like when viewed or demonstrated

These scenarios should represent the **minimum convincing proof** that the project is on the right path.

---

### 6. Vision vs Current Phase Scope
Explicitly separate:
- **The broader vision** (where this could go over time)
- **The scope of the current phase** (what this work is responsible for proving or delivering)

Be clear about:
- what is intentionally included now,
- what is intentionally excluded or deferred,
- and why that focus is appropriate at this stage.

This section is critical for alignment.

---

### 7. Non-Goals & Boundaries
Clearly state:
- What this project is *not* trying to solve
- What success does *not* require at this stage
- Any known constraints or boundaries that should not be crossed

This protects the vision by limiting dilution.

---

## Style & Tone Requirements
- Clear, grounded, and confident
- Write in **UK English suitable for New Zealand** (unless instructed otherwise)
- Plain English, direct and friendly
- No marketing language or hype
- No technical implementation detail
- Written as a trusted partner aligning a team

---

## Final Check Before Output
Before responding, ensure that:
- The vision is clear without prescribing solutions
- The current phase scope is explicitly defined
- A delivery or coding agent could use this to guide decisions
- A stakeholder could read this and understand *why this project matters*

Now produce the **Project Vision Document** in markdown code.
