## Question 1

What is a normal conversion rate from portal inquiry to closed sale for real estate consultants?

A) 30-40%
B) 20-25%
C) 10-20% ✓
D) 5-8%

**Explanation:** Converting 10-20% of portal inquiries into closed sales is normal industry performance. Elite consultants achieve 15-25%. This means losing 8-9 out of 10 leads is typical, not a failure. Understanding this prevents demoralization and helps you focus on systematic improvement rather than taking each loss personally. If you're converting 1 in 10 inquiries, you're performing at industry average.

## Question 2

What is the 10/10/10 rule for processing lost deals?

A) Follow up 10 times over 10 weeks for 10 months
B) 10 minutes to feel it, 10 hours to learn, 10 days to move on ✓
C) Spend 10 hours analyzing every lost deal
D) Wait 10 days before following up after a rejection

**Explanation:** The 10/10/10 rule provides a healthy framework for processing failures: Allow 10 minutes to feel disappointed (it's normal to be upset), spend 10 hours doing objective analysis (what happened, what could improve, what's one specific learning), then move on completely after 10 days (don't dwell on losses—focus on active pipeline). This prevents both emotional dwelling and failure to extract learning.

## Question 3

A client needs a 3-bedroom Downtown apartment for under AED 1.2 million, which doesn't exist. What should you do?

A) Keep searching until you find something
B) Convince them to increase their budget
C) Acknowledge the limitation honestly and offer alternatives ✓
D) Tell them Downtown is overpriced anyway

**Explanation:** This is a Shortcoming Objection—a genuine limitation you cannot overcome. The professional response: "Downtown 3-bedrooms start at AED 3M+. At AED 1.2M, we're looking at studios/1-bedrooms in Downtown OR 3-bedrooms in JVC/Dubai South. Would you like to see alternatives?" Honesty about limitations builds more trust than wasting time on impossible requirements or pressuring budget changes.

## Question 4

When should you walk away from a prospect professionally?

A) After the first objection they raise
B) When they ask tough questions about developer track records
C) After 10+ hours with zero progress toward decision ✓
D) Whenever they don't immediately commit

**Explanation:** Walk away when you've invested significant time (10+ hours) with zero movement toward a decision, when client is disrespectful/abusive, when they ask you to misrepresent facts, or when requirements are impossible and they refuse alternatives. Don't walk away just because prospects ask difficult questions—those are often your best future clients. The key is recognizing when time investment isn't producing any progress.

## Question 5

What should you do after losing a significant deal?

A) Immediately move to next prospect without analysis
B) Spend weeks analyzing what went wrong
C) Log one specific learning and one improvement to implement ✓
D) Avoid similar objection types in future prospects

**Explanation:** The failure learning log approach: Write down what objection caused the failure, what you did, what you could have done differently, and ONE specific improvement for next time. This creates systematic skill development without emotional dwelling or analysis paralysis. Review the log monthly to identify patterns. The goal isn't to avoid difficult objections—it's to get better at handling them through compound learning over time.
