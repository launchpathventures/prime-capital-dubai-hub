## Questions

### Question 1
**What is the legal status of Form F once signed by both buyer and seller?**

A) Non-binding letter of intent  
B) Legally binding contract  
C) Subject to further negotiation  
D) Valid only after developer approval  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Form F is a legally binding contract once signed by both parties. Buyer is committed to purchase, seller is committed to sell, and terms cannot be changed without mutual agreement.

---

### Question 2
**What should the buyer's name on Form F match exactly?**

A) Their business card  
B) Their Emirates ID  
C) Their passport  
D) Their email signature  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The buyer's name must match their passport exactly. Any discrepancy between Form F and passport can cause issues at DLD transfer. Always verify name spelling against the original passport.

---

### Question 3
**What is the typical completion timeline for secondary market transactions from MOU signing?**

A) 7-14 days  
B) 30-60 days  
C) 90-120 days  
D) 6-12 months  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Secondary market transactions typically complete 30-60 days from MOU signing, allowing time for NOC processing, mortgage approval (if applicable), and transfer scheduling.

---

### Question 4
**What happens if the seller defaults on a Form F transaction (fails to complete)?**

A) Seller keeps the deposit  
B) Deposit is returned to buyer, and seller may owe additional compensation  
C) Transaction automatically extends  
D) Agents split the deposit  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** If the seller defaults, the deposit is returned to the buyer. Additionally, the seller may owe compensation to the buyer, typically an amount equal to the deposit.

---

### Question 5
**What is the purpose of a "subject to" condition in Form F?**

A) To make the contract non-binding  
B) To specify conditions that must be met for the transaction to proceed  
C) To reduce the purchase price  
D) To extend the completion timeline automatically  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** "Subject to" conditions specify requirements that must be met (such as mortgage approval or NOC issuance) for the transaction to proceed. They provide an exit if conditions aren't met.

---

### Question 6
**What is a well-drafted "subject to mortgage" condition missing in a poorly drafted version?**

A) Bank name only  
B) Specific loan amount, timeline, and evidence requirements  
C) Interest rate expectations  
D) Broker commission terms  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A well-drafted mortgage condition specifies: the loan amount required, timeline for approval/decline, and what evidence is needed. Simply stating "subject to financing" is too vague and can lead to disputes.

---

### Question 7
**What is the standard commission structure for secondary market transactions?**

A) 4% paid by buyer only  
B) 4% paid by seller only  
C) 2% from buyer + 2% from seller (each to their respective agent)  
D) Negotiated separately outside of Form F  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The standard commission is 2% + VAT from each party (buyer and seller), paid to their respective agents upon successful completion of transfer.

---

### Question 8
**What must be verified before signing Form F to ensure seller can transfer the property?**

A) Seller's bank account balance  
B) Property's Ejari registration  
C) Title deed in seller's name and mortgage/encumbrance status  
D) Building's age  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Before signing, verify the title deed is in the seller's name and check for any existing mortgages or encumbrances that would affect the transfer. These are essential due diligence items.

---

### Question 9
**What is the NOC and why is it required for secondary transactions?**

A) No Objection Certificate from DLD to verify buyer's identity  
B) No Objection Certificate from developer/community confirming all dues are paid  
C) Notification of Completion from the construction company  
D) Notice of Contract from the bank  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The NOC is a No Objection Certificate from the developer or master community confirming all service charges are paid and there are no outstanding dues. It protects the buyer from inheriting the seller's debts.

---

### Question 10
**On transfer day, what is the typical split of the 4% DLD transfer fee?**

A) 4% paid entirely by buyer  
B) 4% paid entirely by seller  
C) 2% buyer, 2% seller  
D) Free for first-time buyers  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The standard market practice is to split the 4% DLD transfer fee equally—2% paid by buyer and 2% paid by seller. However, this can be negotiated differently in the Form F.
