# Competency 0: Foundations

## Overview

Welcome to Prime Capital Dubai. This competency establishes the foundation for your success as a real estate consultant with our firm. Before engaging with clients or properties, you must understand who we are, what we stand for, how we operate, and the professional standards that set us apart in the Dubai market.

## What You'll Learn

This competency covers five essential modules:

1. **Prime Capital Orientation** — Our story, positioning, and what makes us different
2. **Professional Standards** — Code of conduct and client interaction principles
3. **Broker Licensing & Compliance** — Regulatory requirements and RERA compliance
4. **Essential Tools Overview** — CRM, communication platforms, and daily tools
5. **Daily Workflow & Productivity** — Morning routines, time-blocking, and pipeline management

## Why This Matters

Prime Capital's brand promise is simple: we are the "antidote to the Dubai hustle." Every interaction you have with a client either reinforces or undermines this positioning. 

The foundations competency ensures you:
- Understand and embody our brand values
- Meet all regulatory and compliance requirements
- Use our tools efficiently
- Follow workflows that maximize productivity
- Represent the firm with professionalism and restraint

## Time Commitment

**Estimated Duration:** 4 hours total (240 minutes)

You should complete this competency within your first 3 days at Prime Capital. Take your time to absorb the material — rushing through foundations creates problems later.

## Assessment

You'll encounter two knowledge checks:
- **Quiz 1** after Module 0.3 (Broker Licensing & Compliance)
- **Quiz 2** after Module 0.5 (Daily Workflow & Productivity)

Both require 80% to pass. You can retake quizzes if needed.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 0.1: Prime Capital Orientation. Work through the modules in order — each builds on the previous one.
