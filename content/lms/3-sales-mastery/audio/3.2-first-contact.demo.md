**SETUP**

Let me show you two versions of responding to a Property Finder portal lead. In both cases, an investor has just enquired about a two-bedroom apartment at a new Emaar development. Watch for the differences in timing, personalisation, and professionalism.

**WEAK EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent receives notification, finishes current task, responds twelve minutes later]*

Agent: "Hi, thanks for your enquiry. Let me tell you about this amazing development — it has world-class amenities, a stunning pool, twenty-four-hour security, marble floors throughout, floor-to-ceiling windows, and the developer is very reputable."

*[Long pause — no response from lead]*

Agent: "Are you interested in scheduling a viewing? Let me know when you're free."

*[Another long pause]*

Agent: "Hello? Are you still there?"

Investor: "Sorry, I've actually already spoken to someone else about this."

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Went Wrong**

Four problems here. First, the twelve-minute response time — by then, at least two other agents had already made contact. Second, the generic opening — "thanks for your enquiry" says nothing about the specific property they asked about. Third, the feature dump — rattling off amenities without any context of what matters to THIS buyer. And fourth, asking for a viewing without any qualification — you don't know if they're even a real buyer yet.

**STRONG EXAMPLE**

*[Scene: Agent receives notification, responds within forty-five seconds]*

Agent: "Good afternoon, Ahmed! This is Sarah from Prime Capital. I noticed your enquiry about the two-bedroom at Creek Harbour Residences. Great choice — those units have been moving quickly, especially the ones with marina views. Are you free for a quick five-minute call now, or would you prefer I send some key details first?"

Investor: "I'm actually in a meeting right now."

Agent: "No problem at all — I appreciate you picking up. Just one quick question before I let you go: are you looking at this primarily as an investment or for personal use? That way, when we reconnect, I can share the most relevant options."

Investor: "Investment — rental yield is my main focus."

Agent: "Perfect. I'll send you a WhatsApp with my details. What time works better for you — morning or evening?"

Investor: "Evening, around seven."

Agent: "Great, I'll call you at seven this evening. Talk soon."

*[Immediately sends WhatsApp with contact details and confirms callback time]*

**COACH ANALYSIS — What Made It Work**

First, speed — forty-five seconds puts you first. Second, personalisation — using their name and the specific development they enquired about shows you're paying attention. Third, one piece of value — mentioning the marina views adds insight beyond what they already know. Fourth, offering choice — "call now or send details" respects their autonomy. And fifth, the busy recovery — when they couldn't talk, the agent got one qualifying answer and locked in a specific callback time. Even a thirty-second call can move a deal forward.

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

The single biggest difference? Speed plus personalisation. The strong example was fast AND showed they understood the specific enquiry. Anyone can respond quickly with a generic message. Winners respond quickly with something that demonstrates they're already thinking about the buyer's needs.
