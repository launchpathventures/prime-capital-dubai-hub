### Question 1

What is the target response time for Tier 1 leads (portal leads, direct website enquiries)?

- [ ] A) Within 5 minutes
- [x] B) Within 60 seconds
- [ ] C) Within 2 hours
- [ ] D) Same business day

**Explanation:** The 60-second window is critical for Tier 1 leads. Data shows that leads contacted within 60 seconds convert at 3x the rate of those contacted later.

### Question 2

According to the speed-to-lead data, what happens to conversion rates after 5 minutes of response time?

- [ ] A) They stay roughly the same
- [ ] B) They drop by about 20%
- [ ] C) They drop by about 50%
- [x] D) They drop by about 80%

**Explanation:** After 5 minutes, conversion drops approximately 80% compared to immediate response. Speed is a critical competitive advantage.

### Question 3

What is the first thing your 60-second WhatsApp response should do?

- [ ] A) List all the features of the property
- [x] B) Use their name and confirm the specific property they enquired about
- [ ] C) Ask them to schedule a call immediately
- [ ] D) Send your brochure and price list

**Explanation:** Personalisation is key. Using their name and confirming the specific enquiry shows you're responding to them, not sending a generic template.

---

### Question 4

If a lead answers your call but says "I'm busy right now," what should you do?

- [ ] A) Apologise and say you'll call back later
- [ ] B) Push through and give your presentation anyway
- [x] C) Ask one qualifying question before letting them go and confirm a callback time
- [ ] D) End the call immediately without asking anything

**Explanation:** The busy recovery script recommends asking one qualifying question (e.g., investment or personal use) and confirming a specific callback time. This respects their time while maintaining momentum.

---

### Question 5

Which of these is an example of a "generic opener" mistake?

- [ ] A) "I noticed your enquiry about Palm Tower — it's a strong choice for investors."
- [x] B) "Hi, I saw you were looking at property. How can I help?"
- [ ] C) "Good morning! This is Sarah from Prime Capital about your Dubai enquiry."
- [ ] D) "I have some information about the payment plans that might interest you."

**Explanation:** "I saw you were looking at property" is generic — it doesn't acknowledge their specific enquiry and sounds like every other agent.

---

### Question 6

What is the recommended action if there's no response to your initial WhatsApp after 15 minutes?

- [ ] A) Call repeatedly until they answer
- [ ] B) Wait 24 hours before following up
- [x] C) Send a second message with specific value (like key features or a summary)
- [ ] D) Move on to the next lead and forget about them

**Explanation:** The second WhatsApp at 15 minutes should add value — share key facts about the property and offer to discuss when convenient.

---

### Question 7

When a lead says they need to "discuss with their partner first," what's the recommended approach?

- [x] A) Offer to schedule a three-way call or send materials they can share
- [ ] B) Push them to make the decision themselves
- [ ] C) Tell them to call you back when they've decided
- [ ] D) Assume they're not a serious buyer

**Explanation:** Offering to include their partner via a call or providing shareable materials keeps the conversation progressing and respects their decision process.

---

### Question 8

What makes website enquiry leads different from portal leads?

- [ ] A) They are lower quality than portal leads
- [ ] B) They respond better to pressure tactics
- [x] C) They have higher intent because they specifically chose your firm
- [ ] D) They don't need follow-up

**Explanation:** Website enquiry leads specifically sought out your firm, indicating higher trust baseline and intent. They should be acknowledged for choosing you.

---

### Question 9

What should you NEVER do in a first contact message?

- [ ] A) Use the person's name
- [ ] B) Reference the specific property they enquired about
- [x] C) Use urgency tactics like "Act now!" or "Limited availability!"
- [ ] D) Offer to send more information

**Explanation:** Urgency tactics in first contact destroy trust and signal the "pushy agent" behaviour that sophisticated investors want to avoid.

---

### Question 10

The speed-to-lead study found that leads contacted in under 1 minute have what contact rate?

- [ ] A) 56%
- [x] B) 78%
- [ ] C) 45%
- [ ] D) 24%

**Explanation:** Leads contacted within 0-1 minute have a 78% contact rate, compared to only 24% for those contacted after 5-30 minutes.
