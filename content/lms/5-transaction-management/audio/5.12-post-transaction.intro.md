### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Most agents disappear after collecting commission. The deal closes, the cheque clears, and the client never hears from them again. Then these same agents complain about how hard it is to find new clients while ignoring the easiest source of business: people who already trust them.

Here's what sustainable business looks like.

First, the transaction close is the relationship beginning, not the end. Week one follow-up confirms everything is settled. Month one checks resolve any lingering issues. Ongoing communication keeps you relevant without being annoying.

Second, value delivery keeps you top of mind. Quarterly market updates relevant to their property. News about regulations affecting their investment. Anniversary acknowledgments. You're not selling—you're serving.

Third, referrals are earned, then asked for. Deliver exceptional service. Confirm they're satisfied. Then, at an appropriate moment, simply ask: "If you know anyone considering Dubai property, I'd be grateful for the introduction." Most happy clients will refer if asked properly. Most agents never ask.

Fourth, repeat business is gold. Track client profiles for second purchase potential. When opportunities match their investment thesis, share them proactively. Clients who've had good experiences want to work with you again—if you stay in touch.

The key takeaway: Your client list is your most valuable asset. Nurture it. Every satisfied client is a potential referral source and repeat buyer. Every ignored client is a missed opportunity and a relationship wasted. Build for the long term.
