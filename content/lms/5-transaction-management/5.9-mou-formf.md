# MOU & Form F

## Introduction

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), formalized as RERA Form F, is the legally binding agreement that governs secondary market (resale) property transactions. Getting this document right—accurate, complete, and properly executed—is essential for smooth transactions.

This module covers Form F preparation, key clauses, and common issues.

## Understanding Form F

### What is Form F?

**Form F** is the standardized MOU template mandated by RERA for secondary market property sales. It's called "Form F" as part of RERA's numbered form system (Form A = agency agreement, Form B = buyer contract, etc.).

### Purpose

Form F establishes:
- Agreement between buyer and seller on sale terms
- Purchase price and payment structure
- Timeline for completion
- Conditions that must be met
- Consequences of default by either party
- Commission obligations

### Legal Status

**Form F is legally binding.** Once signed by both parties:
- Buyer is committed to purchase
- Seller is committed to sell
- Deposit is at risk if buyer defaults
- Seller faces liability if seller defaults
- Terms cannot be changed without mutual agreement

## Conditions Precedent

### Common Conditions

**"Subject to" Clauses:**

**1. Subject to Mortgage Approval**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Buyer obtaining mortgage financing of [amount] from a UAE bank within [X] days. If mortgage is declined, Buyer may terminate and receive full deposit refund."

**When to Include:** Buyer requires financing

**2. Subject to NOC**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Seller obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the developer/community within [X] days."

**When to Include:** Standard—always required

**3. Subject to Clear Title**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Seller providing clear title, free of any encumbrances, mortgages, or liens."

**When to Include:** Standard best practice

**4. Subject to Inspection**
> "This agreement is conditional upon the Buyer conducting a satisfactory property inspection within [X] days."

**When to Include:** Buyer wants formal inspection period

### Drafting Conditions Properly

**Good Condition:**
> "Subject to Buyer obtaining mortgage pre-approval of minimum AED 1,500,000 within 14 days of this agreement. Buyer to provide written confirmation of approval or decline."

**Poor Condition:**

**Difference:** Good condition specifies amount, timeline, and evidence required.

## Common Form F Issues

### Issue 1: Name Discrepancy

**Problem:** Name on MOU doesn't match passport or title deed

**Prevention:** Triple-check names against original documents

**Resolution:** Amend MOU before signing, or supplementary agreement

### Issue 2: Vague Conditions

**Problem:** "Subject to financing" without specifics

**Prevention:** Draft conditions with clear criteria, timelines, evidence requirements

**Resolution:** Supplementary agreement clarifying condition terms

### Issue 3: Deposit Dispute

**Problem:** Parties disagree on deposit release after default

**Prevention:** Clear default terms; deposit with neutral trustee

**Resolution:** Trustee follows Form F terms; disputes to RERA/courts

### Issue 4: Timeline Extension Conflict

**Problem:** One party wants extension, other refuses

**Prevention:** Build reasonable timelines; include extension provisions

**Resolution:** Follow Form F terms; mediate if possible

### Issue 5: Missing Items at Transfer

**Problem:** Furniture/fixtures in MOU not present at handover

**Prevention:** Detailed inventory list attached to MOU

**Resolution:** Withold portion of price; negotiate resolution
