## Questions

### Question 1
**What is the typical order of stages in an off-plan property transaction?**

A) SPA → EOI → Oqood → Construction → Handover → Title Deed  
B) EOI → SPA → Oqood → Construction → Completion → Handover → Title Deed  
C) Oqood → EOI → SPA → Construction → Handover → Title Deed  
D) EOI → Oqood → SPA → Construction → Title Deed → Handover  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The correct sequence is: EOI (Expression of Interest) → SPA (Sales and Purchase Agreement) → Oqood (contract registration) → Construction period → Completion notice → Handover → Title Deed.

### Question 2
**What is the typical validity period for an Expression of Interest (EOI)?**

A) 24 hours  
B) 1-7 days  
C) 30 days  
D) 90 days  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** EOI validity typically ranges from 1-7 days, varying by developer. During this time, the unit is held while the SPA is prepared. EOI terms should always be clarified with each developer.

---

### Question 3
**What does Oqood registration provide for the buyer?**

A) Title deed to the property  
B) Official registration of buyer's interest with DLD, protecting against double-selling  
C) Mortgage approval from banks  
D) Developer warranty extension  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Oqood registration records the buyer's interest with the Dubai Land Department, preventing the developer from selling the same unit to another buyer. It's not the title deed itself but the foundation for eventual title deed issuance.

---

### Question 4
**How long does Oqood registration typically take after SPA signing?**

A) 1-7 days  
B) 30-60 days  
C) 6 months  
D) Immediate (same day)  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Oqood registration typically takes 30-60 days from SPA signing. The developer prepares documents and submits to DLD, who processes and issues the Oqood certificate.

---

### Question 5
**What is the developer's grace period typically mentioned in SPAs?**

A) 3 months  
B) 6 months  
C) 12 months  
D) 24 months  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** SPAs typically include a 12-month grace period beyond the stated completion date. If the developer exceeds this grace period, the buyer has the right to cancel and receive a full refund.

---

### Question 6
**What should you do BEFORE a client decides on a unit and submits EOI?**

A) Start preparing the SPA  
B) Confirm unit availability with the developer  
C) Schedule the handover appointment  
D) Register the Oqood  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Always confirm unit availability before the client decides—popular units sell quickly. Getting confirmation prevents the situation where a client commits to a unit that has already been sold to someone else.

---

### Question 7
**What triggers the developer's ability to access funds from the escrow account?**

A) Buyer signing the EOI  
B) Time passing since payment was made  
C) Certified completion of construction milestones  
D) Developer's request without verification  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Escrow funds are released to developers only when construction milestones are certified by an independent engineer. This progress-linked release system protects buyer funds and ensures developers earn access to funds by actually building.

---

### Question 8
**What is the cooling-off period for off-plan property purchases in Dubai?**

A) 7 days  
B) 14 days  
C) 30 days  
D) There is no cooling-off period  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Buyers have a 14-day cooling-off period after signing an off-plan SPA, during which they can cancel for any reason and receive a full refund minus administrative fees.

---

### Question 9
**What is the primary purpose of snagging inspection at handover?**

A) To negotiate a lower price  
B) To identify defects before accepting the property  
C) To complete the title deed registration  
D) To set up utility accounts  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Snagging inspection identifies defects, incomplete work, or items not meeting specification before the buyer accepts handover. Issues documented during snagging must be remedied by the developer within the warranty period.

---

### Question 10
**After handover, how long does title deed issuance typically take?**

A) Same day  
B) 7 days  
C) 30-90 days  
D) 6-12 months  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Title deed issuance typically takes 30-90 days after handover, as the Oqood registration is converted to a title deed and the property is officially registered in the buyer's name.
