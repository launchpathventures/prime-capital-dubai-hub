## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontmatter Field Naming (BLOCKER)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue:** All modules used `learning_outcomes` instead of `learning_objectives` (per LMS content format spec).

**Files Updated:**
- 7.1-client-communication.md
- 7.2-follow-up-systems.md
- 7.3-referral-generation.md
- 7.4-long-term-relationships.md

**Change:** Renamed field from `learning_outcomes:` to `learning_objectives:` in frontmatter.

### 2. Module Type Format (BLOCKER)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue:** Module `type` field used lowercase format (`skills`, `skills-script`) instead of proper format per spec (`Skills`, `Skills + Script`).

**Files Updated:**
- 7.1-client-communication.md: `skills` → `Skills`
- 7.2-follow-up-systems.md: `skills` → `Skills`
- 7.3-referral-generation.md: `skills-script` → `Skills + Script`
- 7.4-long-term-relationships.md: `skills` → `Skills`

### 3. Follow-Up Systems Practicality (BLOCKER)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue:** Module 7.2 had follow-up cadence but lacked specific, practical CRM triggers and daily workflows.

**Enhancement Added:**
- **CRM Task Setup section** with automatic triggers based on completion dates
- **Transaction-based triggers**: Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Annual
- **Milestone triggers**: Pre-handover, anniversaries, quarterly check-ins
- **Daily habits checklist**: Morning review (10 min), log interactions, set next steps
- **Weekly review routine**: 15-minute audit process
- **Monthly audit**: Task completion tracking (90%+ target)

This makes the system immediately implementable, not theoretical.

### 4. Missing "Common Mistakes" Sections (WARNING)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue:** Modules 7.1, 7.2, and 7.4 lacked "Common Mistakes" sections showing ❌ Wrong / ✅ Right patterns.

**Sections Added:**

**Module 7.1 (Client Communication):**
- 8 common mistakes with wrong/right patterns
- Focus on email tone, response timing, professional language

**Module 7.2 (Follow-Up Systems):**
- 8 common mistakes with wrong/right patterns
- Focus on CRM discipline, genuine vs. generic outreach, segmentation

**Module 7.4 (Long-Term Relationships):**
- 8 common mistakes with wrong/right patterns
- Focus on lifecycle awareness, strategic positioning, boundary balance

**Module 7.3 (Referral Generation):**
- Already had a "Common Mistakes" table at end of module
- No changes needed (existing content sufficient)

- ✅ Timing-based approach (ask when client is satisfied)
- ✅ Natural language: "I'm always looking to work with people similar to you"

- ✅ Value-first framing throughout

**Module 7.3 Coach Walkthrough includes 4 detailed scripts:**
1. Natural Completion Ask
2. Positive Feedback Response
3. Annual Review Mention
4. Direct Request (Existing Trust)

All scripts feel professional and consultative, not salesy.

### Long-Term Focus ✅

- Lifecycle framework positions consultants as partners
- No short-term pressure tactics

## Practical Usability Assessment

### Module 7.2: Follow-Up Systems (Critical Review)

**Question:** Are the systems practical and usable (not theoretical)?

**Answer:** ✅ YES (after fixes)

**Why this is practical:**

1. **Automatic CRM Triggers** — Specific dates tied to transaction completion
   - Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Annual
   - Off-plan handover reminders (30 days before)
   - Quarterly check-ins for Nurture segment

2. **Daily Workflow** — 10-minute morning routine
   - Check today's tasks
   - Log interactions immediately
   - Set next follow-up before closing record

3. **Weekly Review** — 15-minute accountability check
   - Who is overdue?
   - Who needs re-engagement?
   - What was missed last week?

4. **Monthly Audit** — Measurable targets
   - Task completion rate (target: 90%+)
   - Average days since last contact by segment
   - Identify clients slipping through cracks

5. **Segmentation Framework** — Clear categories
   - Active, Warm, Nurture, Dormant
   - Specific follow-up frequencies for each
   - Criteria for moving between segments

**This is not theoretical — it's immediately implementable in any CRM platform.**
