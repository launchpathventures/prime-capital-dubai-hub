# Sales Mastery Quiz 3
## Closing Techniques

This quiz tests your understanding of Module 3.7: Closing Techniques. You need 80% (8/10) to pass.

### Question 1

What is the correct philosophy of closing according to Prime Capital's approach?

- [ ] A) Closing is about getting them to say yes using any technique that works
- [x] B) Closing is about removing barriers for someone who already wants to buy
- [ ] C) Closing is about pressuring undecided buyers into commitment
- [ ] D) Closing is the final step where you reveal the true price

**Explanation:** Closing is about helping ready buyers make the decision — removing barriers, not manipulating. If someone doesn't want the property, no technique will change that.

### Question 2

Which of these is a high-confidence verbal buying signal?

- [ ] A) "Tell me more about the area"
- [ ] B) "I'll think about it"
- [x] C) "What's the next step?"
- [ ] D) "Can you send me a brochure?"

**Explanation:** "What's the next step?" is a direct buying signal indicating readiness to proceed. Questions about process signal near-decision.

### Question 3

What is an "Assumptive Close"?

- [ ] A) Assuming the buyer can't afford the property
- [ ] B) Telling the buyer they must buy today
- [x] C) Assuming the decision is made and focusing on the logistics of moving forward
- [ ] D) Assuming all objections have been resolved

**Explanation:** The Assumptive Close assumes the buy decision is made and moves directly to logistics — "Let me walk you through what happens next."

---

### Question 4

When should you use the "Summary Close" technique?

- [ ] A) When the buyer shows no interest
- [x] B) When the buyer has expressed multiple positive points but hasn't committed
- [ ] C) When the buyer has many objections
- [ ] D) At the very first meeting

**Explanation:** The Summary Close works when the buyer agrees with many aspects but hasn't formally committed. You summarise their agreements and then ask for commitment.

---

### Question 5

A buyer says "I need to think about it" at the point of close. What's the recommended first response?

- [ ] A) "Take all the time you need and call me when you're ready"
- [x] B) "Of course — what specifically would you like to think through?"
- [ ] C) "If you don't decide now, you'll lose the unit"
- [ ] D) "Don't worry about it, everyone feels this way"

**Explanation:** Ask what specifically they need to think through. This uncovers the real objection so you can address it, rather than letting them leave with unresolved concerns.

---

### Question 6

What is the key difference between legitimate urgency and pressure tactics?

- [ ] A) Legitimate urgency uses bigger discounts
- [ ] B) Pressure tactics are more effective
- [x] C) Legitimate urgency is based on facts that are actually true
- [ ] D) There is no real difference

**Explanation:** Legitimate urgency is based on true facts (units selling, launch pricing ending). Pressure tactics use fabricated urgency that destroys trust when discovered.

---

### Question 7

Which closing technique offers two positive options rather than a yes/no decision?

- [ ] A) The Summary Close
- [ ] B) The Assumptive Close
- [x] C) The Alternative Close
- [ ] D) The Urgency Close

**Explanation:** The Alternative Close offers two options (both positive) rather than yes/no — "Would you prefer the 12th floor or the 18th floor?"

---

### Question 8

When handling the objection "What if property prices crash?", what should you focus on?

- [ ] A) Guaranteeing that prices will only go up
- [ ] B) Dismissing their concern as unlikely
- [x] C) Acknowledging the concern and providing market context while being honest about uncertainty
- [ ] D) Telling them to trust you because you're an expert

**Explanation:** Acknowledge concerns, provide perspective based on market fundamentals, but be honest about market uncertainty. Trust comes from honesty, not false guarantees.

---

### Question 9

After a buyer commits, what's the immediate priority in the "post-close moment"?

- [ ] A) Ask for referrals right away
- [x] B) Confirm their decision was good and set expectations for what happens next
- [ ] C) End the conversation quickly
- [ ] D) Upsell them to a more expensive unit

**Explanation:** The post-close moment should confirm their decision was good (reduces buyer's remorse), explain next steps, and begin the ongoing relationship.

---

### Question 10

What is a common closing mistake that abdicates your responsibility to guide the buyer?

- [ ] A) Using the Summary Close
- [ ] B) Addressing their objections directly
- [x] C) Saying "Let me know when you're ready" and leaving them alone with their doubts
- [ ] D) Offering to answer additional questions

**Explanation:** "Let me know when you're ready" gives no commitment, sets no follow-up, and leaves the buyer alone with unresolved doubts. You should guide them to a decision, not abandon them.
