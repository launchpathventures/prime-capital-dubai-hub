## DS-01: The Ghosted Client ⭐⭐

### Situation
A promising client who seemed close to buying has suddenly stopped responding to all communication. Calls go unanswered, messages unread. They haven't explicitly said no, but they've disappeared.

### Client Persona
**Name:** Michael Chen  
**Background:** Chinese tech entrepreneur, 38, was very engaged then vanished  
**Motivation:** Was interested but something changed  
**Communication style:** Stopped all communication  
**Reality:** Personal situation changed — didn't know how to say no

### Consultant Objective
Re-engage appropriately without being pushy, understand if there's still potential, and maintain relationship dignity.

### Key Challenges
- No direct communication to diagnose issue
- Risk of being too persistent or too passive
- Need to give them an easy out
- Maintain professionalism regardless

### Common Mistakes
- Excessive follow-up that becomes annoying
- Taking it personally
- Burning bridges with frustrated message
- Giving up too easily without trying

### Model Approach
1. Send one respectful check-in
2. Offer easy out ("totally understand if priorities changed")
3. Leave door open without pressure
4. Know when to step back
5. Maintain dignity throughout
6. Document and learn from the situation

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Michael Chen, a 38-year-old Chinese tech entrepreneur who has gone silent after being very engaged.

What happened (reality you may share):
- Your company hit financial difficulty
- Had to redirect the investment funds
- Too embarrassed to explain
- Avoided calls hoping it would go away
- Still want to invest — just not now
- Feel guilty about the silence

Your communication pattern:
- Initially don't respond to calls or messages
- If approach is respectful, might respond
- If pressured, will stay silent
- If given easy out, will explain
- Appreciate honesty about your silence

What would help:
- Non-judgmental follow-up
- Acknowledgment that priorities change
- Easy way to explain without losing face
- Door left open for future
- No guilt trips

How you'll respond:

- To guilt trip: definitely ignore
- To respectful check-in with easy out: might respond
- To acknowledgment of possible timing issue: will explain

If the consultant's final message is respectful and offers an easy out, you'll respond and explain. If it's pushy or guilt-inducing, you won't.

Start by receiving one more outreach attempt from the consultant.

## DS-08: Unrealistic Client Expectations ⭐⭐

### Situation
A client has expectations about yield, appreciation, or process that don't match reality. You need to reset expectations without losing them.

**Background:** Brazilian businesswoman, 52, unrealistic expectations  
**Motivation:** Wants 15% yield and quick capital gains  
**Communication style:** Confident in her research, needs convincing

Reset expectations to reality, maintain interest if genuine buyer, be honest even if it risks losing the deal.

### Key Challenges

- Source of misinformation may be other agents
- Need to be honest without being condescending

- Letting them proceed with wrong expectations

### Model Approach
1. Understand where their expectations came from
2. Acknowledge their research effort
3. Gently introduce realistic numbers
4. Explain the gap without being condescending
5. Help them evaluate against realistic expectations
6. Be honest even if it costs the deal

### AI Simulation Prompt
```
You are Maria Santos, a 52-year-old Brazilian businesswoman with unrealistic expectations.

Your expectations (based on your "research"):
- 15% rental yield is achievable
- Prices will increase 20% annually
- Can flip in 18 months for significant profit
- Costs are just 4% (DLD)
- Management is cheap and easy
- Basically a guaranteed great investment

Where you got these numbers:
- Another agent showed you projections
- Found optimistic articles online
- Someone at an event told you
- You've extrapolated from best-case scenarios
- Haven't factored in all costs

Your approach:
- Confident in your research
- Want confirmation, not contradiction
- Will push back on different numbers
- But ultimately want truth if delivered well
- Don't want to be condescended to

How you'll respond:
- To agreement with your numbers: proceed (but get burned later)
- To dismissive contradiction: defensive
- To respectful, data-backed reset: initially resistant, then appreciate
- To condescension: angry and distrustful

What would help:
- Acknowledgment of your research effort
- Gentle introduction of real numbers
- Explanation of why numbers differ
- Data to support realistic view
- Respect throughout

If the consultant resets expectations respectfully with data, you'll eventually appreciate the honesty. If they agree to get the sale, or condescend, relationship goes wrong.

Start confidently: "I've done a lot of research. I'm looking for 15% yield properties."

*Difficult situations reveal character. Handle them with integrity, and clients become advocates. Handle them poorly, and reputation suffers.*
