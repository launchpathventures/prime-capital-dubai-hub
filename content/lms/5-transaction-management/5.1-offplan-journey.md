# Off-Plan Transaction Journey

## Introduction

Off-plan property purchases represent the majority of investment transactions in Dubai's market. Understanding the complete journey—from first interest to final handover—is essential for guiding clients confidently and professionally.

This module maps the entire off-plan transaction process, explains each stage in detail, and provides a reference checklist you'll use throughout your career.

## The Off-Plan Transaction Timeline

### Overview

A typical off-plan transaction follows this timeline:

| Stage | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1. EOI & Reservation | 1-7 days | Expression of Interest, unit selection, reservation fee |
| 2. SPA Signing | 7-14 days from reservation | Sales and Purchase Agreement execution, down payment |
| 3. Oqood Registration | 30-60 days from SPA | Contract registration with DLD |
| 4. Construction Period | 1-4 years (typical) | Milestone payments, progress updates |
| 5. Completion Notice | 30-60 days before handover | Final payment, snagging preparation |
| 6. Handover | 1-7 days | Inspection, key collection, utility registration |
| 7. Title Deed | 30-90 days post-handover | Final registration with DLD |

---

## Stage 1: EOI & Reservation

### What Happens

**Expression of Interest (EOI):**
- Client selects a unit (or unit type/floor preference)
- EOI form completed with client details
- Reservation fee paid (typically 5-10% or fixed amount like AED 50,000-100,000)
- Unit temporarily held for client

**Duration:** 1-7 days (varies by developer)

### Key Documents

1. **EOI Form** — Client information, unit selection, payment details
2. **Passport Copy** — Client identification
3. **Emirates ID** (if resident) — Additional identification
4. **Payment Proof** — Transfer confirmation or cheque details

### Your Role

- **Verify unit availability** before client commits
- **Explain EOI terms** — refundable vs. non-refundable, validity period
- **Review EOI form** with client before signing
- **Coordinate payment** — ensure correct bank details
- **Track confirmation** — follow up with developer for acknowledgment
- **Communicate timeline** — when SPA will be ready

### Client Communication Script

> "Congratulations on selecting your unit. The next step is completing the Expression of Interest form and paying the reservation fee of [amount]. This holds the unit for you while the Sales and Purchase Agreement is prepared—typically 7-14 days. The reservation fee is [refundable/non-refundable under these conditions]. Do you have any questions about this stage?"

### Common Issues

- **Unit sold to someone else:** Always confirm availability before EOI
- **Client changes mind:** Understand refund policy before client commits
- **Payment delays:** Developer may release unit if payment not received on time
- **Documentation errors:** Verify passport names match exactly

---

## Stage 2: SPA Signing

### What Happens

**Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA):**
- Developer prepares legally binding contract
- Client reviews and signs SPA
- Down payment made (balance of first installment, typically 10-20% total)
- Payment plan confirmed and documented

**Duration:** 7-14 days from EOI (can vary significantly by developer)

### Key Documents

1. **Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA)** — Full contract with terms
2. **Payment Plan Schedule** — Installment amounts and due dates
3. **Floor Plan** — Unit layout and specifications
4. **Specification Sheet** — Finishes, appliances, inclusions
5. **Power of Attorney** (if signing remotely) — Authorized signatory
6. **Down Payment Proof** — Transfer confirmation

### Your Role

- **Review SPA thoroughly** before client meeting
- **Explain key clauses** — completion date, delay penalties, handover conditions
- **Verify payment plan** matches what was agreed during sales
- **Coordinate signing** — in person or via POA
- **Ensure correct payment** — to developer's escrow account only
- **Obtain copies** — fully signed SPA for client records

### Critical SPA Clauses

**Completion Date:**
- Expected handover date
- Developer's grace period (typically 6-12 months)
- Client rights if developer exceeds grace period

**Payment Schedule:**
- Linked to construction milestones OR
- Fixed dates regardless of construction

**Cancellation Terms:**
- Developer cancellation rights
- Buyer cancellation rights
- Refund amounts and timelines

**Handover Conditions:**
- What constitutes "handover ready"
- Snagging process
- Defects liability period

### Client Communication

> "The SPA is the binding contract for your purchase. Before we sign, let me walk you through the key terms: the completion date, payment schedule, and what happens if either party needs to cancel. This document protects both you and the developer. Take time to read it carefully—I'm here to answer any questions."
