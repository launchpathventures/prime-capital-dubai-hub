# BANT+ Qualification

Not every inquiry becomes a transaction, and not every transaction is worth pursuing. Qualification is the skill of determining whether a prospect is ready, able, and suitable for a purchase—and whether you're the right advisor for them.

## Introduction

**For the Client**: Unqualified buyers waste their own time viewing properties they can't or won't purchase. Qualification protects them from frustration.

**For You**: Time spent with unqualified prospects is time not spent with qualified ones. Effective qualification is how you protect your most limited resource.

**For the Transaction**: Deals that fall apart late in the process damage everyone. Early qualification surfaces issues before time and emotion are invested.

## The BANT+ Framework

BANT is a classic qualification framework. We've extended it with two additional dimensions for Dubai real estate advisory.

| Element | Question Being Answered |
|---------|------------------------|
| **B** — Budget | Can they afford the properties that meet their needs? |
| **A** — Authority | Are they the decision-maker, or is someone else involved? |
| **N** — Need | Is there a genuine need driving the purchase? |
| **T** — Timeline | Is there a realistic timeline for completion? |
| **+F** — Fit | Are they a fit for our advisory approach? |
| **+C** — Capability | Can they execute the transaction logistically? |

---

## B — Budget Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Do they have the funds for properties matching their requirements?
- Is their budget realistic for what they're seeking?
- Can they cover all transaction costs (4% DLD, agency fees, etc.)?

### Qualification Questions

> "What budget range are you working with for this purchase?"

> "Have you accounted for transaction costs—typically 6-7% on top of property price?"

> "Is this budget funded from liquid assets, or does it depend on selling something else?"

> "If financing, have you explored UAE mortgage options or spoken with a broker?"

### Red Flags

- **Budget doesn't match requirements**: Wants premium Marina 3-bed but budget is AED 1M
- **Vague budget responses**: "Flexible" or "depends" without any range
- **Dependent on uncertain liquidity**: "Once my other property sells" or "after my funding round closes"
- **No awareness of additional costs**: Surprised by 4% DLD fee

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Budget matches requirements | ✅ Proceed |
| Budget slightly below requirements | Educate on realistic options, adjust expectations |
| Budget significantly misaligned | Have honest conversation or decline to proceed |
| Dependent on uncertain liquidity | Wait until funds are confirmed before investing time |

---

## A — Authority Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Can this person make the purchase decision?
- Who else influences or controls the decision?
- What's the decision-making process?

### Qualification Questions

> "Are you making this decision independently, or will others be involved?"

> "If there are other stakeholders—partner, family, business partners—what's their role in the decision?"

> "Have you discussed this investment with them already? What's their perspective?"

> "What typically happens in your household/business when making decisions of this magnitude?"

### Red Flags

- **Unknown decision-makers**: "I'll need to check with my brother" (who you've never spoken to)
- **Passive language**: "We might be interested if my wife agrees"
- **Absent co-decision-maker**: Refuses to include spouse/partner in conversations
- **Business complexity**: Investment committee or board approval required but not mentioned

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Sole decision-maker | ✅ Proceed |
| Identified co-decision-maker | Request to include them in conversations |
| Vague additional stakeholders | Clarify decision process before proceeding |
| Complex approval process | Understand timeline and requirements |

---

## N — Need Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Is there a genuine need driving this purchase?
- Is the need urgent or exploratory?
- Will the need persist long enough to complete a transaction?

### Qualification Questions

> "What's prompting your search right now? Why now specifically?"

> "If you don't purchase in the next [3/6/12] months, what happens?"

> "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to making a purchase?"

> "What would cause you to put this on hold or decide not to proceed?"

### Red Flags

- **No driving need**: "Just looking," "exploring options," "seeing what's out there"
- **Distant or vague need**: "Eventually we'd like to..." or "Someday we might..."
- **Need is conditional**: "If my visa gets approved..." or "If the business goes well..."
- **Serial explorer**: Has been "looking" for 2+ years without purchasing

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear, time-bound need | ✅ Proceed actively |
| Need exists but not urgent | Stay in touch, don't over-invest time now |
| Exploratory only | Provide information, add to nurture list |
| Conditional need | Wait for condition to resolve |

---

## T — Timeline Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- When do they need to complete the purchase?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are there external deadlines driving the timeline?

### Qualification Questions

> "When would you ideally complete this purchase?"

> "Are there any external deadlines—visa requirements, school enrollment, business needs?"

> "If the right property appeared tomorrow, how quickly could you move?"

> "What's driving that timeline?"

### Red Flags

- **No timeline**: "Whenever we find the right thing" with no sense of urgency
- **Unrealistic timeline**: "Need to complete next week" for a complex transaction
- **Timeline not aligned with need**: Says urgent but calendar shows 18-month window
- **Dependent timeline**: "Once other things fall into place"

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear timeline within 6 months | ✅ Proceed actively |
| Timeline 6-12 months | Stay engaged, pace appropriately |
| Timeline 12+ months or unclear | Light touch, periodic check-ins |
| Urgent but unrealistic | Educate on process, reset expectations |

---

## +F — Fit Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Are they a good fit for Prime Capital's advisory approach?
- Do their values and expectations align with how we work?
- Will this be a productive, respectful relationship?

### Fit Criteria

**Good Fit Signals**:
- Values expertise over transaction speed
- Respects professional boundaries
- Communicates honestly and directly
- Open to education and advice
- Treats advisory as partnership, not service

**Poor Fit Signals**:
- Expects you to show 50 properties before deciding
- Dismissive of expertise ("I know the market")
- Disrespectful of your time (constant no-shows, late night calls)
- Only interested in discounts and kickbacks
- Already working with multiple agents simultaneously

### Qualification Questions

> "What's been your experience with property advisors in the past?"

> "What do you value most in an advisory relationship?"

> "How do you prefer to work—hands-on collaboration or more independent review?"

### Qualification Actions

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Strong fit indicators | ✅ Proceed with confidence |
| Mixed signals | Clarify expectations, proceed cautiously |
| Clear poor fit | Decline politely, refer elsewhere |

---

## +C — Capability Qualification

### What You're Assessing

- Can they logistically execute the transaction?
- Are there practical barriers to completion?
- Do they have necessary documentation and status?

### Capability Requirements

**For International Buyers**:
- Valid passport
- Ability to travel to Dubai (or reliable POA arrangement)
- Ability to transfer funds internationally
- No sanctions or compliance issues

**For Financing**:
- UAE residency or qualifying non-resident status
- Income documentation
- Credit history acceptable to UAE banks
- Deposit funds available

### Qualification Questions

> "Are you able to travel to Dubai for viewings and completion, or would you need to work remotely?"

> "Have you transferred funds internationally before? Any concerns about moving money to UAE?"

> "If financing, do you have the documentation UAE banks typically require—salary certificates, bank statements?"

### Red Flags

- **Cannot visit Dubai**: And unwilling to grant POA
- **Fund transfer concerns**: Restrictions from home country, compliance issues
- **Documentation gaps**: Self-employed with complex income, recent job changes
- **Compliance issues**: PEP status, source of funds concerns

---

## The Qualification Conversation

Qualification doesn't have to feel like an interrogation. Embed it naturally:

**Script Example**:

> "To make sure I'm recommending the right opportunities, let me understand a few things about your situation. What budget range are you comfortable with, including transaction costs?"

[Budget response]

> "Perfect. And who's involved in this decision—is it just yourself, or are there others?"

[Authority response]

> "Understood. What's driving the interest in Dubai right now? Any specific timeline you're working with?"

[Need and Timeline response]

> "Great. Just to confirm logistics—you're able to travel to Dubai for viewings, and there aren't any concerns about fund transfers from your end?"

[Capability response]

## Coach Walkthrough: BANT+ Qualification in Action

*This section demonstrates systematic qualification through a realistic conversation. The `<speak>` tags indicate content optimized for text-to-speech practice.*

<speak>

### Scenario

**Client**: David, reached out via WhatsApp after seeing a property post on Instagram. Says he's "interested in Dubai investment."

**Your Task**: Conduct systematic BANT+ qualification to determine if he's worth prioritizing.

### Sample Qualification Dialogue

**You**: "David, thanks for reaching out. I'd love to help you explore Dubai opportunities. Before we dive into specific properties, let me understand your situation so I can point you in the right direction. What budget range are you working with for this investment?"

**David**: "Oh, I'm flexible. Maybe one to two million."

**You** (noting vague budget): "One to two million AED is a good range—gives us options. Just to clarify, is that including transaction costs, or is that your property budget? There's typically about 6-7% on top for DLD fees and other costs."

**David**: "Oh, I didn't know about those costs. I guess my total budget is around 2 million then."

**You** (Budget = ⚠️ - needs education): "No problem, that's helpful to know. So looking at properties around 1.8 to 1.9 million. Next question: are you making this decision independently, or will others be involved—spouse, business partner, family?"

**David**: "Well, my wife will need to agree. And actually, my brother and I might do this together as a joint investment."

**You** (Authority = ⚠️ - multiple stakeholders): "Got it. Have you and your brother discussed this already? What's his interest level?"

**David**: "We've talked about it casually. He's interested but I haven't sent him anything concrete yet."

**You**: "Makes sense. Would it be helpful to include him in our next conversation, so you're both getting the same information?"

**David**: "Maybe later, let me see what's available first."

**You** (Authority = ❌ - proceed cautiously): "Fair enough. Let me ask about timing—what's prompting your interest in Dubai investment right now?"

**David**: "Just exploring, really. I've been hearing a lot about Dubai, thought I'd look into it."

**You** (Need = ❌ - exploratory only): "That's great that you're doing research. On a scale of 1 to 10, how committed are you to actually making a purchase in the next six to twelve months?"

**David**: "Hmm, maybe a 5 or 6? If I find the right thing, sure."

**You** (Timeline = ❌ - no urgency): "Understood. And just logistics—would you be able to travel to Dubai to view properties, or would you prefer to work remotely?"

**David**: "I'd probably need to see it first, but I'm pretty busy with work. Maybe in a few months?"

**You** (Capability = ⚠️ - timing constraints): "No problem. Let me be honest with you, David. Based on what you've shared, you're in early research mode—exploring options, timeline is flexible, and you'd need to coordinate with your brother and wife before moving forward. That's totally fine, but it means you're not quite ready for active property search yet."

**David**: "Yeah, I guess that's fair."

**You**: "Here's what I'd suggest: I'll send you some market overview materials and a few example properties in your budget range so you can see what's available. You share those with your brother and wife. If everyone's genuinely interested, let's schedule a call with all three of you and I can answer questions properly. Does that sound reasonable?"

**David**: "Yeah, that works."

**You** (Internal scoring: 0 ✅, 4 ⚠️, 2 ❌ = Not prioritizing): "Perfect. I'll send that over today. Stay in touch, and reach back out when you're all aligned and ready to move forward."

## Qualification Scoring

After discovery, score each BANT+ element:

| Element | Score | Criteria |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Budget | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Aligned / Marginal / Misaligned |
| Authority | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Sole / Shared / Unclear |
| Need | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Urgent / Exists / Absent |
| Timeline | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Clear / Vague / None |
| Fit | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Strong / Mixed / Poor |
| Capability | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | Clear / Questions / Barriers |

**Interpretation**:
- 5-6 ✅ = Highly qualified, prioritize
- 3-4 ✅ = Qualified with attention points
- 1-2 ✅ = Likely unqualified, proceed cautiously
- Any ❌ = Address before proceeding

---

## Declining Unqualified Prospects

Sometimes the right answer is no. Do it gracefully:

> "Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure I'm the right fit for what you're looking for right now. You might find better value working with [alternative]. But please do stay in touch if your situation changes."

> "I want to be honest with you. Given [specific issue], I think we'd both be frustrated if we proceed now. Let's reconnect when [condition] is resolved."

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **BANT+ covers six dimensions**: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, Fit, Capability

2. **Qualification protects everyone** — Client's time, your time, and transaction integrity

3. **Red flags require action** — Don't ignore warning signs hoping they'll resolve

4. **Declining is professional** — It's better to say no early than waste everyone's time

5. **Score every prospect** — Systematic qualification prevents emotional decisions
