# Off-Plan Evaluation

## What Off-Plan Means

Off-plan properties are purchased before construction is complete — sometimes before construction has started. The investor commits capital based on plans, renders, and promises rather than a finished product.

Off-plan can offer attractive entry prices and payment terms. It also carries risks that don't exist with ready properties.

## Why Investors Choose Off-Plan

**Advantages:**

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lower entry price | Developers offer early-bird pricing to fund construction |
| Extended payment plans | Spread payments over construction period (2-4 years) |
| Capital appreciation | Price typically increases from launch to handover |
| Customisation | Sometimes possible to select finishes or make changes |
| Portfolio access | New developments may offer unit types not available in secondary |

**The key question:** Do these advantages outweigh the risks for this specific investor?

## The Core Risks

### 1. Developer Risk

Not all developers are equal. Some have impeccable track records. Others have histories of delays, quality issues, or worse.

**Questions to research:**

- How many projects has this developer completed in Dubai?
- Were previous projects delivered on time?
- What do owners in completed buildings say about quality?
- Is the developer registered with RERA?
- What's the developer's financial stability?

**Red flags:**
- First project in Dubai (no track record to evaluate)
- History of significant delays (18+ months)
- Quality complaints in completed projects
- Financial difficulties or ownership changes

### 2. Completion Risk

The property may be delayed. Construction may take longer than promised. In extreme cases, projects are cancelled.

**Mitigation:**
- RERA escrow accounts protect buyer funds
- Choose developers with consistent delivery records
- Understand the current construction stage

### 3. Market Risk

The market may change between purchase and completion. Values could fall, or rental demand could shift.

**Consideration:**
- Off-plan commitments are typically 2-4 years
- The investor must be comfortable with market uncertainty
- Ready properties eliminate this timing risk

### 4. Specification Risk

The finished product may differ from what was shown. Renders are marketing materials, not photographs.

**Mitigation:**
- Review specifications carefully (not just images)
- Visit the developer's completed projects
- Understand what's included vs. optional

## Developer Due Diligence Checklist

Use this checklist before recommending any off-plan property:

### Developer Profile

- [ ] **RERA registration confirmed** — Verify on DLD website
- [ ] **Years operating in Dubai** — Minimum 5 years preferred
- [ ] **Completed projects** — At least 3 delivered projects
- [ ] **Delivery track record** — Less than 12 months average delay
- [ ] **Financial stability** — No recent negative press or restructuring

### Project Specifics

- [ ] **Escrow account registered** — Funds protected per UAE law
- [ ] **Construction status** — Ground broken, or still approvals pending?
- [ ] **Completion timeline** — Realistic based on current stage
- [ ] **Payment plan structure** — Majority during or post-construction?
- [ ] **Cancellation terms** — What happens if you need to exit?

### Quality Indicators

- [ ] **Visit completed project** — Same developer, similar segment
- [ ] **Review specifications** — Appliances, finishes, flooring
- [ ] **Check service charge estimate** — Often higher in new buildings
- [ ] **Community amenities** — What's actually included vs. masterplan vision

### Location Assessment

- [ ] **Infrastructure timeline** — Metro, roads, retail — when delivered?
- [ ] **Comparable ready properties** — What do completed units rent for?
- [ ] **Area development stage** — Established or emerging?
- [ ] **Accessibility** — Current access vs. future access

## Evaluating Payment Plans (Preview)

Off-plan payment plans vary significantly. Common structures:

| Structure | Description | Investor Profile |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 60/40 | 60% during construction, 40% on handover | Balanced approach |
| 80/20 | 80% during construction, 20% on handover | Lower cash on handover |
| 40/60 | 40% during construction, 60% post-handover | Lower upfront commitment |
| 10/90 | 10% deposit, 90% on completion | Maximum leverage |

Module 4.4 covers payment plan analysis in detail.

## How to Present Off-Plan to Investors

### Frame the Trade-offs

**Don't say:** "This is a great opportunity — you'll make money when it completes."

**Do say:** "Off-plan offers a lower entry point and extended payments, but you're committing capital 3 years before you can rent the property. Let me share what I've found on this developer's track record."

### Be Honest About Unknowns

**Don't say:** "The area will definitely develop by handover."

**Do say:** "The masterplan shows retail and a metro station by 2027. Based on similar developments, infrastructure often arrives 12-18 months after residential handover. That affects initial rental demand."

### Present Developer Evidence

When recommending an off-plan property, share specific due diligence:

"I've evaluated this developer across four criteria:

1. **Track record:** They've completed 8 projects in Dubai since 2015. Average delay has been 6 months — below the industry average.

2. **Quality:** I visited their Marina project from 2021. Finish quality is good, and the building is well-maintained.

3. **Financial stability:** Publicly listed, consistent revenue growth, no restructuring.

4. **This project:** Construction is at Level 12 of 35. Escrow account is registered. Completion target is Q2 2026."

## When to Recommend Ready vs. Off-Plan

| Investor Profile | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Needs rental income immediately | Ready |
| Has limited capital, wants entry | Off-plan (extended payment) |
| Risk-averse, first Dubai purchase | Ready |
| Comfortable with 3-year horizon | Either |
| Specific unit type unavailable ready | Off-plan |
| Concerned about current market values | Off-plan (potential discount) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Developer matters most** — Research track record before anything else
2. **Escrow protects funds** — Verify registration
3. **Delays are common** — Plan for 6-12 months beyond target
4. **Renders aren't reality** — Visit completed projects by same developer
5. **Payment plans vary** — Match structure to investor cash flow
6. **Be honest about risks** — Never oversell off-plan certainty
