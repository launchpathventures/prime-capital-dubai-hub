# Assessment Scenarios — Set B
## Alternate Assessment Scenario Package

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use For:** Retake assessments (second attempt after development period)

---

## Overview

This document contains alternate scenarios for candidates who need to retake the certification assessment. Using different scenarios ensures the assessment remains a valid test of readiness, not a test of memory from the first attempt.

**Important:** These scenarios should remain confidential. Do not share with trainees.

## Scenario 1: Discovery — Lost Deal to Competitor (DS-02)

**Source:** Difficult Situations Scenarios > DS-02  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Grace under disappointment, relationship preservation

### Setup Brief

> "You'll be speaking with Sarah Williams, a British marketing executive. She's been your client for several weeks, but she's calling to tell you she's purchased through a different agency. The deal is done."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Composure | Do they handle disappointment gracefully? |
| Client Focus | Do they still care about her even though deal is lost? |
| Communication | Professional and dignified response? |
| Market Knowledge | Can they learn from what happened? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they accept gracefully?** The deal is done. Fighting or guilting won't help.

2. **Do they ask what influenced the decision?** Learning from this is valuable — but only if asked respectfully.

3. **Do they wish her well genuinely?** Not passive-aggressively.

4. **Do they leave the door open for future?** She may buy again.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Sarah:**
- You feel awkward and apologetic
- The other agent offered to share commission savings (saved ~AED 30K)
- You valued Prime Capital's service — feel guilty
- You might buy again in future
- Not looking for conflict

**What actually happened (share if asked):**
- Other agent was more aggressive on price
- Process was slightly faster
- Property was similar to what Prime Capital showed
- Feel bad about it but decision is made

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Be apologetic, make it easy to accept
- Higher: Be more matter-of-fact, less apologetic

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Accepts gracefully, congratulates genuinely, asks for feedback respectfully, maintains relationship
- **Concern signals:** Shows bitterness, badmouths competitor, makes client feel guilty, burns the bridge

## Scenario 2: Objections — Handling Final Hesitation (OB-02/CL-02)

**Source:** Closing Scenarios > CL-02  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Finding real concerns, providing reassurance without pressure

### Setup Brief

> "You're Sarah Chen, a Singaporean doctor. You've done all your due diligence, the property ticks all your boxes, your finances are ready — but you're hesitating at the final moment. You're not sure why."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Client Focus | Do they dig for the real concern? |
| Composure | Do they push or give space? |
| Communication | Reassuring without pressuring? |
| Process | Do they respect her decision process? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they accept hesitation is normal?** Last-minute nerves on big decisions are human.

2. **Do they probe gently for the real concern?** She doesn't know why she's hesitating — can they help her find it?

3. **Do they give space without abandoning?** Not "take your time" and walk away, but supportive presence.

4. **Can they help her through without pushing?** The skill is guidance, not pressure.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Sarah:**
- Genuinely interested but nervous at the final moment
- Not sure why you're hesitating
- Your real concern (which you may not articulate clearly): fear of making a mistake, what if something better comes along, it's a lot of money, committing feels scary

**How you express it:**
- "I just need to think about it one more time"
- "Are you sure this is the right one?"
- "Maybe I should look at one more option"
- "What if I'm missing something?"

**Your needs:**
- Not pressure to decide
- Acknowledgment that it's a big decision
- Confidence that you've done the right process
- Permission to feel nervous

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Share your concerns more readily when asked
- Higher: Be vaguer about what's bothering you, make them work to find it

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Finds the underlying concern through gentle questioning, provides reassurance without pressure, lets her decide
- **Concern signals:** Pushes for immediate decision, creates urgency, dismisses her hesitation, gives up too easily

## Scenario 3: Presentation — Rental Yield Analysis (PR-09)

**Source:** Presentation Scenarios > PR-09  
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Primary Test:** Financial accuracy, honest yield presentation

### Setup Brief

> "You're Patricia Obi, a Nigerian surgeon investing for rental income. You've been told Dubai yields are 8-10%. You want to understand what you'll actually receive, net of all costs."

### What You're Evaluating

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Market Knowledge | Do they know realistic yield figures? |
| Process Expertise | Can they explain all costs? |
| Communication | Clear breakdown without jargon? |
| Client Focus | Honest about expectations? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they distinguish gross vs net yield?** This is fundamental. Trainees must understand the difference.

2. **Do they include ALL costs?** Service charge, management, vacancy, maintenance, insurance...

3. **Do they give realistic numbers?** If advertised is 8% gross, what's actually net?

4. **Do they factor in vacancy?** What happens when tenants leave?

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Patricia:**
- Want passive income for retirement
- Will manage remotely from Lagos
- Have been told Dubai yields are "8-10%"
- Very detail-oriented about costs
- Need to understand what you'll actually receive

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's realistic monthly rental income?"
- "What are ALL the costs I'll have?"
- "How do we get from gross to net yield?"
- "What happens when the tenant leaves?"
- "How much does property management cost?"
- "What should I realistically budget for?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Accept explanations that cover the main points
- Higher: Probe for every cost, challenge numbers, ask for worst-case

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Explains gross vs net clearly, lists all costs accurately, provides realistic net yield figure, discusses vacancy honestly
- **Concern signals:** Only quotes gross yield, misses significant costs, overpromises returns, vague on actual numbers

## Scenario 4: Closing — Remote Closing Process (CL-07)

**Source:** Closing Scenarios > CL-07  
**Duration:** 8-10 minutes  
**Primary Test:** International process knowledge, practical guidance

| Dimension | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Process Expertise | Do they know remote closing options? |
| Communication | Clear explanation of POA process? |
| Market Knowledge | Know international requirements? |
| Client Focus | Address practical concerns? |

### Key Moments to Watch

1. **Do they know Power of Attorney process?** This is key for remote closing — they must know the steps.

2. **Can they explain document authentication?** What needs to be done in France? Notarization?

3. **Do they address security concerns?** She's trusting a lot to remote process — is it legally valid?

4. **Can they coordinate across time zones?** Practical consideration.

### Evaluator Persona Notes

**Playing Sophie:**
- Work commitments prevent Dubai travel
- Happy to give Power of Attorney if needed
- Want secure, legally valid process

- "What's the Power of Attorney process?"
- "Do documents need to be notarized in France?"
- "How does payment work from abroad?"
- "Is this process legally secure?"
- "What if something needs my physical signature?"

**Adjust difficulty by:**
- Lower: Accept reasonable process explanations
- Higher: Probe for specific legal requirements, express more concern about security

### Scoring Focus

- **Pass level:** Explains POA process clearly, knows documentation requirements, addresses security professionally, offers practical solutions
- **Concern signals:** Uncertain about remote process, vague on documentation, doesn't know POA requirements

|-----------|----------|
| Composure | Do they stay calm when attacked? |
| Client Focus | Do they hear him out before defending? |

## Key Differences from Set A

|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Discovery | Needs analysis (proactive) | Relationship recovery (reactive) |
| Objection Handling | Market data challenges | Emotional hesitation |

Same guidance as Set A:

> "Okay, let's pause there. How did that feel?"
> [Quick note, 30 seconds]
> "Good. Next scenario: You're now [new persona]..."

---

## Overall Assessment

Same rubric and criteria as Set A:

**Pass criteria:**
