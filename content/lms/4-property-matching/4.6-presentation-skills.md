# Property Presentation

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to **present any property shortlist using Investment Score data** and confidently answer "Why this property?" with structured reasoning.

---

## The Purpose of Presentation

You're not selling a property. You're helping an investor make a confident decision.

The difference matters:

- **Selling** pushes towards a transaction
- **Advising** provides clarity for a decision

When you present properties well, investors feel informed and empowered. When you oversell, they feel pressured and sceptical.

**The Prime Capital standard:** Every presentation references the Investment Score and connects features to stated requirements.

---

## Before the Presentation

### Know Your Shortlist Rationale (The 3-Factor Property Match)

Before presenting anything, be able to answer:

- Why did each property pass the hard filters?
- How does each score on the investor's soft preferences?
- What's the Investment Score (gross yield, net yield, total return)?
- What are the trade-offs for each option?
- Which property would I recommend if asked, and why?

### Prepare Your Materials

Have ready:
- Floor plans (accurately measured)
- Location maps
- Comparable rental data
- Payment plan details (if off-plan)
- Developer information (if off-plan)
- Service charge figures
- Your yield calculations

### Set the Right Expectations

**Before presenting:**

"I've identified three properties that fit your criteria. None is perfect — they each have trade-offs. My goal is to give you enough information to decide which, if any, is worth pursuing. I'll share my view, but the decision is yours."

## The Presentation Structure

### 1. Restate the Brief

Start by confirming you understood their requirements. This demonstrates listening and creates a framework for evaluation.

**Example:**

"Just to confirm what we discussed: you're looking for a 2-bedroom apartment in Marina or JBR, budget up to AED 2.5 million, ready property because you want immediate rental income, and sea view is a priority. Is that still accurate?"

### 2. Introduce the Shortlist

Give context before diving into details.

**Example:**

"Based on that brief, I've shortlisted three properties. The first is in Marina with full sea view — it ticks the most boxes but is at the top of your budget. The second is in JBR, slightly under budget, partial sea view. The third is in Marina, best value per square foot, but it's a side view rather than sea view. Let me walk you through each."

### 3. Present Each Property Consistently

Use the same structure for each property so they're comparable:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Location** | Building, area, floor |
| **Size and layout** | Bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage |
| **View and aspect** | What you're looking at |
| **Condition** | Ready, completion date, or current state |
| **Price and payment** | Cost and terms |
| **Yield** | Expected return (with calculation) |
| **Why I selected it** | Connection to their requirements |
| **Trade-offs** | What's not perfect about this option |

### 4. Give Your Recommendation (When Asked)

Investors often want your view. Give it — but frame it appropriately.

**Don't say:** "You should buy this one."

**Do say:** "If I were in your position, I'd lean towards the Marina property. It costs more, but the view commands a rental premium, and resale liquidity is stronger for sea-view units. That said, if budget certainty matters more than view, the JBR option gives you headroom and a solid return."

## Coach Walkthrough: Property Presentation

This section demonstrates a property presentation conversation. Study how the consultant presents options without pressure.

### Scenario

An investor (Sarah, based in London) is looking for an investment property in Dubai. After discovery, you've identified that she wants:
- 1-2 bedroom apartment
- Budget: AED 1.2-1.5 million
- Ready property (immediate rental)
- Good rental yield (targeting 5%+ net)
- Established area with strong resale demand

You've shortlisted two properties and are presenting them over a video call.

### The Conversation

**Consultant:** "Sarah, thanks for making time. I've found two properties that fit what we discussed. Before I share them, let me confirm I've understood your requirements correctly.

You're looking for a 1-2 bedroom in an established area, budget between 1.2 and 1.5 million, ready property so you can start earning immediately, targeting 5% or better net yield, and you want something with good liquidity when you eventually sell. Does that still capture it?"

---

**Sarah:** "Yes, that's right. Maybe leaning towards a 1-bed if the numbers work better."

---

**Consultant:** "Good to know. Both options I have are 1-beds, so that works.

Let me share my screen and walk you through them.

**Property One: Marina Diamond, Unit 1407**

This is a 1-bedroom in Marina Diamond, 14th floor, partial marina view. The building is about 8 years old, well-maintained, managed by Emaar Community Management.

- Size: 850 square feet plus balcony
- Asking price: AED 1,280,000
- Current status: Vacant, immediate handover
- Service charges: AED 15 per square foot, so about AED 12,750 annually

The unit was previously rented at AED 75,000. Based on current comparables, I'd estimate AED 78,000 is achievable. That gives a gross yield of 6.1%, and after service charges, management, and vacancy allowance, you're looking at approximately 4.8% net.

Why I selected it: It's in your budget with room to spare, excellent building reputation, and Marina has proven rental demand and resale liquidity. The marina view, even partial, holds value.

The trade-off: The yield is slightly under your 5% target. To hit 5%+, you'd either need to negotiate the price down by about AED 50,000, or we'd need to find a property in a higher-yield area."

---

**Sarah:** "What's the second option?"

---

**Consultant:** "**Property Two: JLT Cluster M, Unit 806**

This is a 1-bedroom in JLT, 8th floor, lake view. Building is newer — completed in 2019 — and well-managed.

- Size: 780 square feet
- Asking price: AED 1,050,000
- Current status: Tenanted at AED 62,000 until November
- Service charges: AED 13 per square foot, so about AED 10,140 annually

With the existing tenant at AED 62,000, the gross yield is 5.9%. Net yield is approximately 5.2% after costs.

Why I selected it: It hits your yield target, significantly under budget, and JLT has good tenant demand from young professionals. The existing tenant is a bonus — you'd start earning immediately with no vacancy gap.

The trade-off: JLT is less prestigious than Marina for resale. When you come to sell, Marina properties typically move faster and command stronger prices per square foot. You're trading some capital appreciation potential for better immediate yield."

---

**Sarah:** "So Marina for capital growth, JLT for cash flow?"

---

**Consultant:** "That's a good summary. If your priority is rental income and you're comfortable holding for 5-7 years, JLT makes sense. If you're focused on total return and might want to sell sooner, Marina is more resilient.

The AED 230,000 price difference is also meaningful. That capital could sit in a savings account earning 4-5%, or go towards a second property in future."

---

**Sarah:** "Which would you choose?"

---

**Consultant:** "Honestly? For pure investment, I'd probably take JLT. The yield is strong, the tenant removes vacancy risk, and the lower entry price gives you optionality.

But if I wanted something I might use personally in future — or if I valued having a 'Dubai Marina address' — I'd pay the premium for Marina Diamond.

Neither is wrong. It depends on whether you're optimising for income or prestige."

---

**Sarah:** "Can I view both?"

---

**Consultant:** "Absolutely. For the Marina unit, we can schedule anytime this week. For JLT, we need to coordinate with the tenant, but they've been cooperative on viewings. I'll arrange both for the same day so you can compare directly.

Would Thursday work for you?"

---

### Key Teaching Points

Notice what the consultant does:

1. **Confirms requirements first** — Shows they listened
2. **Sets expectations** — "Neither is perfect"
3. **Presents consistently** — Same structure for both properties
4. **Explains the "why"** — Why each property was selected
5. **States trade-offs honestly** — Doesn't hide weaknesses
6. **Gives opinion when asked** — "For pure investment, I'd probably..."
7. **Ends with action** — Schedules viewings

---

## Viewing Best Practices

### Before the Viewing

- **Confirm access** — Nothing worse than arriving to a locked door
- **Plan the route** — Know where to park, how to access
- **Prepare the agent** — If another agent is present, brief them on your client
- **Check unit condition** — Visit beforehand if possible

### During the Viewing

- **Let them explore** — Don't hover or narrate constantly
- **Answer questions, don't volunteer** — Overselling feels desperate
- **Point out relevant features** — "You mentioned sea view was important — come see this"
- **Acknowledge drawbacks** — "The second bedroom is compact — that's the trade-off for the view"
- **Watch their body language** — It tells you more than their words

### After the Viewing

- **Give them space** — Don't ask "So what do you think?" immediately
- **Summarise in writing** — Send a follow-up with property details and your recommendation
- **Be patient** — Significant decisions take time

## Key Takeaways

1. **Present with Investment Score** — Every property includes gross yield, net yield, total return
2. **Restate the brief first** — Confirm you understood before presenting
3. **Present consistently** — Same structure for each property (location, size, price, yield, trade-offs)
4. **State trade-offs honestly** — Every property has weaknesses; acknowledge them
5. **Give your view** — When asked, share your recommendation with reasoning
6. **Let them decide** — Your job is clarity, not pressure
7. **Handle "Why this one?"** — Use the framework: requirements fit, Investment Score, trade-off

---

## Handling "Why This Property?"

When investors ask this question, use this three-part structure:

### Part 1: Requirements Fit
"This property meets all your stated requirements: [budget], [location], [bedrooms], [completion status]."

### Part 2: Investment Score
"The numbers are strong: [gross yield]% gross, [net yield]% net after costs, and with [X]% projected appreciation, your total return is approximately [total]%."

### Part 3: Trade-off Acknowledgment
"The trade-off compared to alternatives is [specific weakness]. I selected it because [specific advantage that outweighs the weakness for this client]."

### Example Response

"Why the Marina property over JLT?

**Requirements fit:** Both meet your brief, but Marina is your preferred area and has stronger resale liquidity.

**Investment Score:** Marina shows 4.9% net yield versus JLT at 5.1%. But total return is 10.9% versus 9.1% because Marina's appreciation historically outperforms.

**Trade-off:** You're paying AED 250,000 more and getting a smaller unit. I selected it because you mentioned you might want to sell in 5 years, and Marina's liquidity protects your exit options."
