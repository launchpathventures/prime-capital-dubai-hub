# Follow-Up Sequences

## Module 3.6 — Skills

The fortune is in the follow-up. Most deals don't close on the first conversation — they close because you stayed present without becoming a nuisance. This module gives you the system.

---

## The Follow-Up Reality

### Why Follow-Up Matters

**The data:**
- 48% of salespeople never follow up
- 25% make a second contact and stop
- 12% make more than three contacts
- 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups

**What this means:**
- Most of your competition gives up early
- Persistence (done right) is a competitive advantage
- The challenge is following up without being annoying

### The Follow-Up Mindset

**Wrong mindset:** "I need to chase them until they buy"
**Right mindset:** "I need to stay valuable until they're ready"

The difference is huge. Chasing creates pressure. Staying valuable creates relationship.

## The Full Follow-Up Sequence

### Standard Sequence: Portal Lead to Decision

| Day | Action | Channel | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| **Day 0** | Immediate response | WhatsApp + Call | First contact, establish relationship |
| **Day 1** | Value follow-up | WhatsApp | Share relevant insight or resource |
| **Day 3** | Check-in | Call | Gauge interest, answer questions |
| **Day 5** | Value follow-up | Email | Market update or new availability |
| **Day 7** | Reconnect | WhatsApp | Light touch, offer help |
| **Day 14** | Re-engagement | Call | Final attempt before reducing intensity |

### After Day 14: Long-Term Nurture

If no response after Day 14, reduce to monthly:
- Monthly market update
- New launch notifications
- Seasonal check-ins (end of year, Ramadan)

---

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 0: Immediate Response

**Goal:** Establish contact and relationship

**Script:**
> "Good [morning/afternoon], [First Name]!
>
> This is [Your Name] from Prime Capital. I noticed your enquiry about [Property/Development Name].
>
> It's a strong choice — [one specific positive about the property].
>
> Are you free for a quick 5-minute call now, or would you prefer I send some key details first?"

**If no response in 4 hours:**
> "Hi [First Name], just following up on my earlier message. I have some information about [Development] that might be useful. Let me know if you'd like me to send it through."

### Day 1: Value Follow-Up

**Goal:** Provide value, not pressure

**Script:**
> "Hi [First Name], I put together a quick comparison of the payment plans available at [Development] — thought it might help with your research.
>
> [Attach document or share key points]
>
> Happy to walk through this whenever convenient."

**Alternative (if you have specific intel):**
> "Hi [First Name], just wanted to let you know — the developer released additional units on the floor you were interested in. Two new options available if you'd like to see them."

### Day 3: Check-In Call

**Goal:** Have a real conversation, understand their position

**Script:**
> "Hi [First Name], it's [Your Name] from Prime Capital. Just checking in — did you get a chance to review the information I sent?
>
> [Listen]
>
> Any questions I can help with?
>
> [If still interested but not ready] No problem at all. Mind if I check in again in a few days? I'll keep an eye on availability in the meantime."

**If voicemail:**
> "Hi [First Name], it's [Your Name] from Prime Capital. Just following up on [Development]. Give me a call back when you have a moment, or drop me a WhatsApp. Talk soon."

### Day 5: Value Follow-Up (Email)

**Goal:** Provide market context

**Subject:** Quick update on [Area/Development]

**Body:**
> "Hi [First Name],
>
> Wanted to share a quick market update on [Area].
>
> [1-2 sentences of relevant market news]
>
> This might affect timing if you're still considering [Development]. Happy to discuss what this means for your situation.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]"

### Day 7: Light Touch Reconnect

**Goal:** Stay present without pressure

**Script:**
> "Hi [First Name], hope you're having a good week.
>
> Just wanted to check if anything has changed on your end, or if there's anything I can help with?
>
> No pressure — just here if you need me."

### Day 14: Re-Engagement

**Goal:** Final active outreach before reducing intensity

**Script:**
> "Hi [First Name], I realise you've been busy. I wanted to reach out one more time about [Development].
>
> If now isn't the right time, I completely understand. I'll keep you on my list for relevant opportunities.
>
> But if you're still interested and just haven't had a chance to circle back, I'd love to help. What's the best way to move forward?"

## Message Frameworks

### The Value-Add Framework

Every follow-up should offer something, not just ask for something.

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge (brief, human)
2. Provide value (insight, update, resource)
3. Invite next step (low pressure)

**Example:**
> "[Acknowledge] Hi [First Name], hope you had a good weekend.
>
> [Value] I noticed [Developer] just announced early handover bonuses for buyers who complete before [date] — could be relevant given the timeline we discussed.
>
> [Invite] Worth a quick chat?"

### The Curiosity Framework

Ask a question that prompts engagement.

**Structure:**
1. Reference previous conversation
2. Ask a thought-provoking question
3. Make responding easy

**Example:**
> "Hi [First Name], thinking about our conversation last week —
>
> Given the rental yields we discussed, I'm curious: are you leaning more toward immediate rental income or longer-term capital growth?
>
> Either changes which options I'd prioritise for you."

### The Scarcity Framework (Use Sparingly)

Only when genuinely true.

**Structure:**
1. State the fact
2. Explain the impact
3. Offer solution

**Example:**
> "Hi [First Name], quick heads up —
>
> The two-bed units we discussed at [Development] are down to the last three. I wanted to let you know before they're gone.
>
> If you want to hold one while you decide, I can walk you through the EOI process."

## What NOT to Do

### Follow-Up Failures

**1. The Desperate Check-In**
> ❌ "Hi, just checking in again. Haven't heard from you. Are you still interested?"

*Problem: Adds no value, sounds desperate, creates guilt.*

**2. The Guilt Trip**
> ❌ "I've sent you several messages without a response. Please let me know if you're no longer interested."

*Problem: Makes them feel bad, damages relationship.*

**3. The Pressure Push**
> ❌ "The unit you liked is almost gone! You need to decide TODAY!"

*Problem: Creates pressure, often not true, damages trust.*

**4. The Empty Follow-Up**
> ❌ "Hi, just following up."

*Problem: No value, no reason to respond.*

**5. The Over-Follow-Up**
> ❌ Messaging every day for two weeks

*Problem: Harassment, not helpfulness.*

### How to Fix Each:

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "Just checking in" | "Wanted to share this update..." |
| "Haven't heard from you" | "When you have a moment..." |
| "You need to decide TODAY" | "Availability is limited — wanted you to know" |
| "Just following up" | "Thought you might find this useful..." |
| Daily messages | Follow the sequence (Day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14) |

## When to Persist vs. When to Release

### Signs to Persist

- They've responded positively before
- They've asked questions (even challenging ones)
- They've said "not now" (vs. "not interested")
- Market conditions favour acting soon
- You have genuine new information to share

### Signs to Release

- Multiple explicit "not interested" signals
- They've asked you to stop contacting them
- No engagement after Day 14 sequence
- They've purchased elsewhere
- Your follow-ups are becoming harassment

### The Release Script

If you decide to step back:

> "Hi [First Name], I sense the timing might not be right for this, and I don't want to be a pest.
>
> I'll step back for now, but please know the door is always open. If your situation changes or you have questions down the road, I'm here.
>
> Best of luck with everything."

**Why this works:**
- Respects their autonomy
- Leaves door open
- Maintains dignity for both parties
- Sometimes prompts re-engagement

## Building Your Follow-Up System

### Non-Negotiables

1. **CRM discipline** — Log every contact, set next action
2. **Reminders** — Never rely on memory
3. **Templates** — Pre-written messages for each stage
4. **Tracking** — Know which leads are at which stage
5. **Review** — Weekly pipeline review to catch missed follow-ups

### Template Library

Create templates for:
- Day 1 value follow-up
- Day 3 check-in (voicemail)
- Day 5 email update
- Day 7 light touch
- Day 14 re-engagement
- Long-term nurture
- Release message

Personalise each with:
- Their name
- The property/development
- Any specific details from your conversations

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Follow-up is where deals happen** — Most competitors give up too early
2. **Value, not pressure** — Every message should offer something
3. **Use the sequence** — Day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 keeps you disciplined
4. **Know when to release** — Persistence has limits
5. **Build the system** — Templates, CRM, reminders

---

## Practice Exercise

**Build your template library:**

1. Write out your personal version of each day's message
2. Customise the tone to match your style
3. Save in your CRM or notes app
4. Test with a colleague — do they sound human or robotic?

**This week:**
- Audit your current pipeline
- Identify leads that need follow-up
- Apply the sequence starting today
