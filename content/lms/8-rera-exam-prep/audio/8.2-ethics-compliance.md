MODULE 8.2: Ethics & Code of Conduct
TYPE: knowledge

### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Ethics questions make up twenty-five to thirty percent of your RERA exam. More importantly, they're where most candidates get tripped up by scenarios that seem straightforward but have specific regulatory answers.

The Professional Ethics Charter has four pillars: integrity, transparency, professionalism, and client interest. You need to know how these translate into actual duties.

Here's where candidates consistently fail: confidentiality exceptions. Many believe confidentiality is absolute — it isn't. You can disclose client information with written consent, when required by court order, to prevent a crime, or when a regulatory authority like RERA or DLD demands it.

Another trap: conflict of interest. Disclosure alone isn't enough. You need written consent. Verbal acknowledgment? That's not acceptable.

The exam loves scenarios where duties appear to conflict. A seller instructs you to hide a property defect. Your duty of disclosure to buyers overrides the duty of obedience to your client. You must disclose the defect.

Here's the principle that guides everything: fiduciary duty means client interests first — but never at the expense of honesty or the law.

Document retention? Five years minimum. That number appears on exams repeatedly.
