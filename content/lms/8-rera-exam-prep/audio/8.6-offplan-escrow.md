### INTRO (60-90 seconds)

Off-plan regulations appear in ten to fifteen questions on a typical RERA exam. The framework is designed around buyer protection, and understanding why these rules exist helps you remember them.

The most tested topic is termination forfeiture under Law 6 of 2019. Here's the rule: if construction is at sixty percent or more, the developer can forfeit a maximum of forty percent of payments made. If construction is below sixty percent, maximum forfeiture is twenty-five percent.

Think of it as forty-sixty-twenty-five. Forty percent maximum forfeiture when construction is at sixty percent or above. Twenty-five percent maximum when below sixty percent.

All buyer payments must go directly to the project's escrow account — one hundred percent, no exceptions. Escrow funds are released based on construction progress, certified by independent engineers. Developers cannot withdraw freely.

Before selling off-plan units, developers must register the project with RERA, establish an escrow account, and typically demonstrate twenty percent construction completion.

What does a buyer receive for an off-plan purchase? An Oqood certificate — not a title deed. The title deed is only issued after the property is completed and handed over. Oqood registration costs four percent of property value, same as the transfer fee.
