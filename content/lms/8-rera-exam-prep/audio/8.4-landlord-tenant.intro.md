Landlord-tenant questions are where most candidates fail the RERA exam. The rules are specific, the numbers are exact, and getting them wrong means losing marks you can't afford to lose.

Here's the most important number in this module: twelve months. That's the notice period for non-renewal — whether for personal use, renovation, or sale. Landlords cannot give shorter notice and expect to evict at lease end.

Don't confuse this with the thirty-day notice for breach during a tenancy. Non-payment of rent? Thirty days to pay. Illegal use? Immediate grounds for eviction. But deciding not to renew at lease end? Twelve months notice, delivered via notary public or registered mail.

Rent increase notice requires ninety days before lease expiry. Miss that deadline? The existing rent continues for another year.

Rent increases are capped by the RERA Rental Index. If the rent is within ten percent of market rate, no increase is allowed at all. If it's eleven to twenty percent below market, maximum five percent increase.

Ejari registration is mandatory for all tenancies. Without it, the Rental Disputes Centre won't hear your case.

These numbers — twelve months, ninety days, thirty days — they're the difference between passing and failing.
