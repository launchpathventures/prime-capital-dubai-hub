  - id: "cd2-q1"
    question: "What does BANT+ stand for in the qualification framework?"
    options:
      - text: "Budget, Ability, Need, Timeline, plus Flexibility"
        correct: false
      - text: "Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, plus Fit and Capability"
        correct: true
      - text: "Balance, Authority, Negotiation, Trust, plus Commitment"
        correct: false
      - text: "Budget, Assessment, Need, Terms, plus Follow-up"
        correct: false
    explanation: "BANT+ covers Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, plus Fit (advisory relationship fit) and Capability (logistical ability to complete)."

  - id: "cd2-q2"
    question: "A client says their budget is 'flexible'. This is a red flag for which BANT+ element?"
    options:
      - text: "Authority"
        correct: false
      - text: "Need"
        correct: false
      - text: "Budget"
        correct: true
      - text: "Timeline"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Vague budget responses ('flexible', 'depends') without any range are a Budget red flag. Qualified buyers know their financial parameters."

  - id: "cd2-q3"
    question: "What question best qualifies Authority?"
    options:
      - text: "What's your budget range?"
        correct: false
      - text: "Are you making this decision independently, or will others be involved?"
        correct: true
      - text: "When do you want to complete?"
        correct: false
      - text: "Have you invested in property before?"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Authority is about decision-making power. You need to know who decides and who else influences the decision."

  - id: "cd2-q4"
    question: "A prospect has been 'looking at property' for 2+ years without purchasing. This is a red flag for which element?"
    options:
      - text: "Budget"
        correct: false
      - text: "Authority"
        correct: false
      - text: "Need"
        correct: true
      - text: "Capability"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Serial explorers who have been 'looking' for years typically lack genuine Need. Without a real driving need, transactions don't close."

  - id: "cd2-q5"
    question: "What's the appropriate action when a client has Budget and Need but unclear Authority?"
    options:
      - text: "Proceed as normal"
        correct: false
      - text: "Request to include the decision-maker in conversations"
        correct: true
      - text: "Decline to work with them"
        correct: false
      - text: "Wait for them to decide"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When authority is shared or unclear, request to include all decision-makers. Deals fail when decision-makers aren't aligned."

  - id: "cd2-q6"
    question: "Which is a Fit red flag in the BANT+ framework?"
    options:
      - text: "Client wants to see properties before deciding"
        correct: false
      - text: "Client is working with multiple agents simultaneously"
        correct: true
      - text: "Client has a 12-month timeline"
        correct: false
      - text: "Client is based overseas"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Working with multiple agents simultaneously indicates the client doesn't value advisory relationships—a poor fit for Prime Capital's approach."

  - id: "cd2-q7"
    question: "A client says they need to sell another property to fund this purchase. How should you score Budget?"
    options:
      - text: "✅ - They have the funds"
        correct: false
      - text: "⚠️ - Dependent on uncertain liquidity"
        correct: true
      - text: "❌ - Disqualified"
        correct: false
      - text: "Ignore and proceed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When budget depends on selling another property (uncertain liquidity), score as ⚠️ and wait until funds are confirmed before investing significant time."

  - id: "cd2-q8"
    question: "What's the minimum BANT+ score threshold for a 'highly qualified' prospect?"
    options:
      - text: "2-3 green checkmarks"
        correct: false
      - text: "5-6 green checkmarks"
        correct: true
      - text: "All elements must be green"
        correct: false
      - text: "Only Budget and Timeline need to be green"
        correct: false
    explanation: "5-6 ✅ across all BANT+ elements indicates a highly qualified prospect deserving prioritization. 3-4 is qualified with attention points."

  - id: "cd2-q9"
    question: "A client shows hostility when you ask about their financial situation. What does this indicate?"
    options:
      - text: "They're definitely qualified"
        correct: false
      - text: "You should skip financial qualification"
        correct: false
      - text: "Potential Fit concerns and possible Budget issues"
        correct: true
      - text: "They need more time to trust you"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Hostility around reasonable qualification questions signals poor Fit (doesn't respect professional process) and may indicate Budget concerns they're hiding."

  - id: "cd2-q10"
    question: "Which Capability issue is most likely to prevent transaction completion?"
    options:
      - text: "Client prefers email communication"
        correct: false
      - text: "Client cannot travel to Dubai and is unwilling to grant POA"
        correct: true
      - text: "Client needs mortgage pre-approval"
        correct: false
      - text: "Client wants to visit properties in person"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If a client cannot visit Dubai and won't grant Power of Attorney, they cannot physically complete a transaction. This is a fundamental Capability barrier."

  - id: "cd2-q11"
    question: "What's the correct approach when a prospect is unqualified?"
    options:
      - text: "Proceed anyway and hope for the best"
        correct: false
      - text: "Ghost them without explanation"
        correct: false
      - text: "Decline politely and refer elsewhere if appropriate"
        correct: true
      - text: "Ask them to contact you when they're qualified"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Gracefully declining unqualified prospects is professional. Offer to refer elsewhere if appropriate, and invite them to reconnect when circumstances change."

  - id: "cd2-q12"
    question: "When should qualification questions be asked in the discovery process?"
    options:
      - text: "Only at the end, after showing properties"
        correct: false
      - text: "Embedded naturally throughout the discovery conversation"
        correct: true
      - text: "In a separate qualifying call"
        correct: false
      - text: "Only if you suspect they're unqualified"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Qualification should be embedded naturally in discovery, not a separate interrogation. Phrase questions conversationally to gather information without discomfort."
