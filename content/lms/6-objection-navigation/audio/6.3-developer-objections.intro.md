"What if the developer doesn't deliver?" "I've heard about delays." "How do I know the quality will be what they're promising?"

Developer and project objections are particularly common with off-plan purchases, where investors commit capital before they can see or touch what they're buying. These objections deserve serious attention—they represent real risks.

Behind these concerns lies a fear of betrayal: "I'll trust them with my money and they'll let me down." This manifests as delivery concerns, timeline worries, quality questions, or financial protection fears.

Your role is to help investors assess these risks accurately, understand the protections that exist, and make informed decisions about which projects merit confidence. Don't push clients toward developers you wouldn't trust yourself. When timeline is critical, off-plan may not be the right choice—say so.

In this module, you'll learn to navigate developer concerns with honesty and evidence. Let's see what this looks like in practice.
